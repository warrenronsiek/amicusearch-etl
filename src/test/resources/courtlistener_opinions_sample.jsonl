The Clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Defendant American Biltrite, Inc. (ABI) is the manufacturer of Amtico vinyl floor tile and sheet vinyl flooring that contained asbestos. Plaintiff's decedent, Italo Pompani, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014, which led to his death in 2016. The complaint alleges that decedent's exposure to asbestos products, including Amtico floor tiles, contributed to the development of his lung cancer. At his deposition, decedent testified that, at various job sites during his career as an electrician, he worked as close as five feet from flooring installers installing Amtico asbestos-containing floor tiles and sheet vinyl flooring, which produced visible dust that he inhaled.<\/p>\n<p>In asbestos exposure and other toxic tort cases, \"an opinion on causation should set forth a plaintiff's exposure to a toxin, that the toxin is capable of causing the particular illness (general causation) and that plaintiff was exposed to sufficient levels of the toxin to cause the illness (specific causation)\" (<i>Parker v Mobil Oil Corp.<\/i>, 7 NY3d 434, 448 [2006]; <i>accord Nemeth v Brenntag N. Am.<\/i>, ___ NY3d ___, 2022 NY Slip Op 02769, *1 [2022]).

In its motion for summary judgment, defendant established prima facie a lack of specific causation. In particular, defendant submitted a report affirmed by industrial hygienist John W. Spencer of Environmental Profiles, Inc. (EPI). Spencer relied on a 2007 EPI study of airborne asbestos generated by cutting Amtico tiles. The study found an eight-hour weighted average airborne concentration level of less than .00044 fibers per cubic centimer (f\/cc). Based on that finding, Spencer calculated that decedent's work near Amtico tile installations exposed him to a cumulative dose of .0000086 [*2]f\/cc, a level \"indistinguishable from mot ambient measurements and below occupational exposure levels.\" This report establishes that decedent was not exposed to levels of asbestos from its products sufficient to contribute to his lung cancer.<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiff's opposition failed to raise any issue of fact as to specific causation. A showing that the decedent \"work[ed] in dust laden with asbestos generated from products containing asbestos\" accompanied by \"expert testimony that dust raised from manipulating asbestos products 'necessarily' contains enough asbestos to cause mesothelioma\" is not enough (<i>Nemeth <\/i>at *2 n 3). Plaintiff's medical expert did point to simulation studies measuring an average level of airborne asbestos as high as 0.27 f\/cc during the cutting, sanding, and snapping of asbestos-containing floor tile. He did not, however, provide any correlation between the asbestos fiber levels to which plaintiff may have been exposed and the amount of inhaled asbestos that would have caused decedent's lung cancer (<i>see Nemeth<\/i> at *3; <i>Dyer v Amchem Prods.

Defendant Romona Keveza is the chief executive officer, founder, and managing member of defendants Romona Keveza Collection LLC (RKC), Romona Keveza One Rock LLC, and Romona Keveza 1 Rock LLC (collectively defendants).<\/p>\n<p>RKC and Chen Inc. entered into a Photography Services Agreement in which RKC agreed to pay $6,000 to Chen Inc. for an October 1, 2019 photoshoot. After RKC failed to pay in full, Mr. Chen, on behalf of Chen Inc., filed a complaint against RKC with the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection's Office of Labor &amp; Policy Standards (OLPS) on October 12, 2019. OLPS is the administrative body with jurisdiction over FIFA complaints. As discussed below, that jurisdiction is not exclusive, and a FIFA complainant may proceed directly in court.<\/p>\n<p>OLPS provides complainants with a complaint form. \"Additional Question 5\" on the OLPS complaint form asks: \"Were you hired to do the work individually or as part of a group of two or more people?\" Mr. Chen checked the box demarcated \"Group of [*2]2 or more.\"<\/p>\n<p>The complaint in this action alleges that Kozlovska provided modeling services for defendants from 2017 to 2019. In November 2019, Kozlovska filed a complaint against RKC with OLPS alleging that RKC failed to pay her for modeling services. Kozlovska stated that she worked for defendants for approximately two years and that the \"[h]iring agreement was made through third party, my modeling agency.\" Like Mr. Chen, in response to Additional Question 5 on the OLPS complaint form, Kozlovska checked the box indicating that she was hired to perform work as a group of two or more individuals.<\/p>\n<p>After RKC failed to respond to Chen Inc.'s and Kozlovska's complaints, OLPS sent notices to both plaintiffs and to defendants entitled \"Notice of Hiring Party's Failure to Respond to Complaint,\" which stated, inter alia, \"<b><i>When a hiring party fails to respond to a Notice of Complaint within 20 days it creates a rebuttable presumption in any civil action commenced pursuant to [FIFA] that the hiring party committed the violations alleged in the complaint.<\/i><\/b>\" On May 26, 2020, plaintiffs jointly commenced the instant action against defendants alleging violation of FIFA.<sup><b>[FN2]<\/b><\/sup><\/p><div align=\"center\"><i>THE FREELANCE ISN'T FREE ACT<\/i><\/div>\n<p>\/i&gt;<\/p>\n<p><i>Enacted November 16, 2016 and effective May 15, 2017, FIFA is the first act of its kind in this country to provide legal protections for freelance workers against nonpayment for work performed (OLPS Navigation Program Guide for Freelance Workers, at 3, available at https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/assets\/dca\/downloads\/pdf\/workers\/Court-Navigation-Freelance.pdf [last updated Mar. 15, 2021]). FIFA defines a \"freelance worker\" as \"any natural person or any organization composed of no more than one natural person, whether or not incorporated or employing a trade name, that is hired or retained as an independent contractor by a hiring party to provide services in exchange for compensation\" (FIFA 20-927). A central issue in this case is whether plaintiffs fit within this definition.<sup><b>[FN3]<\/b><\/sup><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>FIFA defines a \"hiring party\" as \"any person who retains a freelance worker to provide any service\" with exceptions that are not applicable to defendants (FIFA 20-927). FIFA provides that \"whenever a hiring party retains the services of a freelance worker and the contract between them has a value of $800 or more,\" the contract \"shall be reduced to writing\" and contain certain information specified therein (\u00a7 20-928[a], [b]). The hiring party must pay the freelance worker by the date specified in the contract or \"no later than 30 days after the completion of the freelance worker's services\" if no date is specified (\u00a7 20-929[a]). If a hiring party violates FIFA, then the freelance worker may file a complaint either with OLPS or in court (\u00a7\u00a7 20-931, 20-933). A freelance worker is not required to file an administrative complaint before bringing an action in court.<sup><b>[FN4]<\/b><\/sup><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>If a complainant chooses to file a complaint with OLPS, the Commissioner must notify the hiring party of the complaint within 20 days. The [*3]notice must include a copy of the complaint and inform the hiring party that their \"failure to respond to the complaint creates a rebuttable presumption in any civil action commenced pursuant to this chapter that the hiring party committed the violations alleged in the complaint\" (\u00a7 20-931 [d]). The hiring party then has 20 days to submit a reply (\u00a7 20-931 [e] [1]).<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>If the hiring party fails to respond within 20 days, then the Commissioner may close the case (\u00a7 20-931 [e] [3]). Under such circumstances as in Chen Inc.'s and Kozlovska's cases, if the defendant does not answer the OLPS complaint, then \"the [C]ommissioner shall mail a notice of non-response to both the freelance worker and the hiring party,\" along with proof that the Commissioner previously mailed the hiring party a notice of complaint warning that failure to timely answer will result in a rebuttable presumption that the hiring party violated FIFA (\u00a7\u00a7 20-931 [d], [e] [3]).<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>A complainant may also file a civil action in \"any court of competent jurisdiction\" (\u00a7 20-933 [a] [1]). A freelance worker who prevails on a claim alleging unlawful payment practices (as described in \u00a7 20-929) \"is entitled to an award for double damages, injunctive relief and other such remedies as may be appropriate\" under FIFA, as well as attorneys' fees and costs (\u00a7 20-933 [b] [1], [3]).<\/i><\/p><p><i>DISCUSSION<\/i><\/p>\n<p>On its appeal, RKC submits that Supreme Court should have dismissed Chen Inc.'s FIFA claim. Kozlovska cross-appeals from Supreme Court's dismissal of her claim against all defendants.<\/p>\n<p>When \"a defendant moves for dismissal of a cause of action under CPLR 3211 (a) (1), their documentary evidence must 'utterly refute[] the plaintiff's factual allegations, conclusively establishing a defense as a matter of law'\" (<i>Himmelstein, McConnell, Gribben, Donoghue &amp; Joseph, LLP v Matthew Bender &amp; Co.<\/i>, 37 NY3d 169, 175, quoting <i>Goshen v Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N.Y.<\/i>, 98 NY2d 314, 326 [2002]; <i>see also Balay v Manhattan 140 LLC<\/i>, 204 AD3d 491, 492-493 [1st Dept 2022] [\"The court should not have granted the Owner's cross motion to dismiss based on documentary evidence because the evidence submitted . . . did not conclusively establish a defense\"]).<\/p>\n<p>When considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211 [a] [7], \"we must give the pleadings a liberal construction, accept the allegations as true and accord the plaintiff[ ] every possible favorable inference\" (<i>Sassi v Mobile Life Support Servs., Inc.<\/i>, 37 NY3d 236, 239 [2021]). \"The question is whether the complaint adequately alleged facts giving rise to a cause of action\" (<i>id.<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>We decline to consider RKC's arguments because RKC did not move for dismissal of Chen Inc.'s FIFA claims before Supreme Court. We reinstate Kozlovska's claim as defendants failed to negate as a matter of law her contention that she is a freelance worker under FIFA.<\/p>\n<p>RKC argues that Supreme Court should have dismissed Chen Inc.'s FIFA claim pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (1) and (7) because documentary evidence [*4]established that Chen Inc. was not a freelance worker and therefore had no cause of action. In support, RKC points to the Photography Services Agreement stating that Chen Inc. would provide four people for the photoshoot, invoices for the overtime hours that Mr. Chen and his assistants worked, and Mr. Chen's OLPS complaint in which he stated that he was hired to work as part of a group of two or more people. These documents, RKC says, irrefutably showed that Chen Inc. fell outside of FIFA's definition of a freelance worker.<\/p>\n<p>In opposition, plaintiffs argue that Supreme Court properly denied RKC's motion as Chen Inc. was comprised solely of Mr. Chen and therefore fell within FIFA's definition of a freelance worker. Plaintiffs argue that the group of three additional workers for whom RKC and Chen Inc. contracted were other freelancers\u2014not Chen Inc.'s employees\u2014and that the documentary evidence offered by RKC did not conclusively prove otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>However, neither party mentions that RKC's motion to dismiss did not seek dismissal of Chen Inc.'s claim. As RKC did not seek such relief below, it cannot do so before us. Both Chen Inc. and Mr. Chen were named plaintiffs on the complaint, and RKC could have but did not move to dismiss Chen Inc.'s claim. Instead, RKC moved to dismiss only the claim brought by Mr. Chen individually and conceded that Chen Inc. was a distinct legal entity. In response, Mr. Chen voluntarily withdrew his claim. RKC now improperly and unconvincingly transposes its arguments against Mr. Chen individually to Chen Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Kozlovska argues that Supreme Court should not have dismissed her claim because she sufficiently pleaded a cause of action under FIFA, and defendants failed to furnish documentary evidence definitively disposing of her claim.<\/p>\n<p>RKC contends that they proved that Kozlovska was not a freelance worker through an invoice from VNY, VNY's entity listing with the New York Department of State, and Kozlovska's affidavit from a prior action. RKC maintains that Kozlovska was neither a freelance worker under FIFA nor in contractual privity with RKC because RKC and nonparty VNY had \"a continuing agreement\" under which VNY provided models \"on an 'as needed' basis.\" RKC also argues that Kozlovska had conceded in an affidavit that VNY entered into an agreement with RKC and issued an invoice to RKC, and that Kozlovska was not a party to either document. RKC further submits that Kozlovska was an employee of VNY rather than a freelance worker per the model booking agreement.<\/p>\n<p>These documents are not dispositive. The unpaid invoice and VNY's entity information do not conclusively establish that Kozlovska was an employee of VNY. While Kozlovska's affidavit from a prior action states that she was represented by an agency and that her agency communicated with defendants regarding outstanding payment, it also states that Kozlovska was considered a freelance worker and that she had a direct relationship with Keveza. The affidavit is therefore [*5]equivocal and is not determinative of whether Kozlovska was a freelance worker.<\/p>\n<p>While RKC references an agreement between itself and VNY, RKC did not furnish this agreement. RKC notes that Kozlovska indicated on her OLPS complaint form that she was hired as part of a group of two or more and that the \"[h]iring agreement was made through third party, my modeling agency.\" While it is unclear what OLPS's internal procedure is once it receives a complaint, OLPS continued to process the complaint and issued a rebuttable presumption in Kozlovska's favor despite these statements. Discovery could shed light on OLPS's process. The fact that OLPS issued a rebuttable presumption in Kozlovska's favor suggests that these statements were not fatal to her FIFA claim.<\/p>\n<p>FIFA's text is silent as to how to factor an agent into the calculus of whether someone is a freelance worker.<sup><b>[FN5]<\/b><\/sup> The Act does not mandate direct contracting between a freelance worker and the hiring party (<i>see<\/i> FIFA 20-927). While FIFA does not explicitly address its applicability to workers represented by agents, the plight of such workers was certainly before the City Council when it passed FIFA in the form of testimony from FIFA proponents in various industries sharing that freelance workers utilize agents. FIFA identifies specific categories of individual workers who are not freelancers under the Act. Notably, persons who are represented by an agent are not included in that finite list (<i>see<\/i> \u00a7 20-927).<\/p>\n<p>Given the inconclusive record before us, we cannot determine whether Kozlovska fell outside of FIFA's definition of a freelance worker at this early pleading stage. Therefore, Kozlovska's claim is reinstated, and the parties should engage in discovery to ascertain whether Kozlovska has a viable cause of action under FIFA. Discovery from OLPS may also illuminate this question, as deference may be warranted to an administrative agency's interpretation and \"specific application of a broad statutory term\" that it is charged with implementing (<i>Matter of O'Brien v Spitzer<\/i>, 7 NY3d 239, 242 [2006]; <i>see Matter of Peyton v New York City Bd. of Stds. &amp; Appeals<\/i>, 36 NY3d 271, 280 [2020] [deference to an agency is appropriate when interpretation is consistent with legislative intent, \"involves knowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices,\" and is \"neither irrational, unreasonable nor inconsistent with the governing statute\"]).<\/p>\n<p>For similar reasons, RKC's motion to dismiss Kozlovska's claim pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (3) and (7) should be denied. The record before us does not clearly support RKC's contention that Kozlovska lacks standing or lacks a cause of action under FIFA. Dismissal is therefore improper.<\/p>\n<p>Concerning the proper defendants for Kozlovska's claim, the \"hiring party\" here is unclear. The complaint alleged that Kozlovska furnished services to all defendants, and the documentary evidence submitted by defendants did not conclusively refute this allegation. Supreme Court therefore [*6]erred in dismissing Kozlovska's claims against all defendants. However, to the extent that Kozlovska relies on a veil-piercing theory to pierce RKC's corporate veil (as opposed to FIFA's definition of \"hiring party\"), the complaint failed to allege the necessary elements (<i>see Shisgal v Brown,<\/i> 21 AD3d 845, 848 [1st Dept 2005]).<\/p>\n<p>RKC argues that Supreme Court abused its discretion in denying its motion to vacate the default judgment pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (1). RKC claims that its failure to file responsive pleadings was due to its counsel's inadvertence. RKC submitted an affidavit from Keveza in which she stated that \"as we are headquartered in Toronto . . . and due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing many Toronto notarial locations, I had a great deal of difficulty finding a United States notary\" to notarize documents for the case. RKC further argues that it has a meritorious defense: Chen Inc. and Kozlovska were not freelance workers as defined in FIFA and therefore had no causes of action. Plaintiffs counter that RKC failed to establish entitlement to vacatur of the default judgment.<\/p>\n<p>It is well settled that \"[t]his State has a strong public policy for deciding cases on the merits\" (<i>US Bank N.A. v. Richards<\/i>, 155 AD3d 522, 523 [1st Dept 2017]). While RKC's counsel could have taken additional steps to notify Supreme Court of its purported difficulties in filing responsive pleadings, RKC ultimately filed pleadings. Further, the delay was not lengthy and Keveza's affidavit set forth a reasonable excuse for the delay. Moreover, as discussed above, it is unclear whether Kozlovska was a freelance worker under FIFA. It is therefore possible that RKC has a meritorious defense. Accordingly, Supreme Court erred in denying RKC's motion to vacate the default judgment.<\/p>\n<p>The parts of the orders dated May 28, June 10, June 17, and June 30 sanctioning defense counsel are not appealable as of right, as they did not result from motions made on notice (<i>see Sholes v Meagher,<\/i> 100 NY2d 333, 335 [2003]). Contrary to RKC's claim that it sought vacatur of the sanctions orders, the record indicates that it sought only vacatur of the part of the June 17 order granting Chen Inc.'s motion for a default judgment. Furthermore, even if we were to grant permission to appeal (<i>see<\/i> CPLR 5701 [c]) \u2014 although RKC does not request such relief \u2014 RKC lacks standing to appeal awards of sanctions against its counsel(<i>see Moore v Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.,<\/i> 94 AD3d 638, 639 [1st Dept 2012], <i>appeal dismissed<\/i> 19 NY3d 1065 [2012]).<\/p>\n<p>In light of the foregoing, defendants' remaining arguments are academic.<\/p>\n<p>Accordingly, the order of the Supreme Court, New York County (Nancy M. Bannon, J.), entered on or about March 11, 2021, which, to the extent appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied RKC's motion to dismiss Chen Inc.'s claim against it and granted defendants' motion to dismiss Kozlovska's claim against them, should be modified, on the law, to reinstate Kozlovska's claim against all defendants[*7], and otherwise affirmed, without costs.

Photography business Joseph Chen, Inc. (Chen Inc.) and model Dina Kozlovska commenced the underlying action alleging that defendants violated FIFA after failing to pay for work they performed. Chen Inc. is a single-entity corporation comprised of former plaintiff Joseph Chen for the purpose of operating his photography business.<sup><b>[FN1]<\/b><\/sup> Kozlovska is represented by nonparty VNY Model Management, Inc. (VNY), although the scope of that representation is unclear from the record before us. Defendant Romona Keveza is the chief executive officer, founder, and managing member of defendants Romona Keveza Collection LLC (RKC), Romona Keveza One Rock LLC, and Romona Keveza 1 Rock LLC (collectively defendants).<\/p>\n<p>RKC and Chen Inc. entered into a Photography Services Agreement in which RKC agreed to pay $6,000 to Chen Inc. for an October 1, 2019 photoshoot. After RKC failed to pay in full, Mr. Chen, on behalf of Chen Inc., filed a complaint against RKC with the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection's Office of Labor &amp; Policy Standards (OLPS) on October 12, 2019. OLPS is the administrative body with jurisdiction over FIFA complaints. As discussed below, that jurisdiction is not exclusive, and a FIFA complainant may proceed directly in court.<\/p>\n<p>OLPS provides complainants with a complaint form. \"Additional Question 5\" on the OLPS complaint form asks: \"Were you hired to do the work individually or as part of a group of two or more people?\" Mr. Chen checked the box demarcated \"Group of [*2]2 or more.\"<\/p>\n<p>The complaint in this action alleges that Kozlovska provided modeling services for defendants from 2017 to 2019. In November 2019, Kozlovska filed a complaint against RKC with OLPS alleging that RKC failed to pay her for modeling services. Kozlovska stated that she worked for defendants for approximately two years and that the \"[h]iring agreement was made through third party, my modeling agency.\" Like Mr. Chen, in response to Additional Question 5 on the OLPS complaint form, Kozlovska checked the box indicating that she was hired to perform work as a group of two or more individuals.<\/p>\n<p>After RKC failed to respond to Chen Inc.'s and Kozlovska's complaints, OLPS sent notices to both plaintiffs and to defendants entitled \"Notice of Hiring Party's Failure to Respond to Complaint,\" which stated, inter alia, \"<b><i>When a hiring party fails to respond to a Notice of Complaint within 20 days it creates a rebuttable presumption in any civil action commenced pursuant to [FIFA] that the hiring party committed the violations alleged in the complaint.<\/i><\/b>\" On May 26, 2020, plaintiffs jointly commenced the instant action against defendants alleging violation of FIFA.<sup><b>[FN2]<\/b><\/sup><\/p><div align=\"center\"><i>THE FREELANCE ISN'T FREE ACT<\/i><\/div>\n<p>\/i&gt;<\/p>\n<p><i>Enacted November 16, 2016 and effective May 15, 2017, FIFA is the first act of its kind in this country to provide legal protections for freelance workers against nonpayment for work performed (OLPS Navigation Program Guide for Freelance Workers, at 3, available at https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/assets\/dca\/downloads\/pdf\/workers\/Court-Navigation-Freelance.pdf [last updated Mar. 15, 2021]). FIFA defines a \"freelance worker\" as \"any natural person or any organization composed of no more than one natural person, whether or not incorporated or employing a trade name, that is hired or retained as an independent contractor by a hiring party to provide services in exchange for compensation\" (FIFA 20-927).

The hiring party must pay the freelance worker by the date specified in the contract or \"no later than 30 days after the completion of the freelance worker's services\" if no date is specified (\u00a7 20-929[a]). If a hiring party violates FIFA, then the freelance worker may file a complaint either with OLPS or in court (\u00a7\u00a7 20-931, 20-933). A freelance worker is not required to file an administrative complaint before bringing an action in court.<sup><b>[FN4]<\/b><\/sup><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>If a complainant chooses to file a complaint with OLPS, the Commissioner must notify the hiring party of the complaint within 20 days. The [*3]notice must include a copy of the complaint and inform the hiring party that their \"failure to respond to the complaint creates a rebuttable presumption in any civil action commenced pursuant to this chapter that the hiring party committed the violations alleged in the complaint\" (\u00a7 20-931 [d]). The hiring party then has 20 days to submit a reply (\u00a7 20-931 [e] [1]).<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>If the hiring party fails to respond within 20 days, then the Commissioner may close the case (\u00a7 20-931 [e] [3]). Under such circumstances as in Chen Inc.'s and Kozlovska's cases, if the defendant does not answer the OLPS complaint, then \"the [C]ommissioner shall mail a notice of non-response to both the freelance worker and the hiring party,\" along with proof that the Commissioner previously mailed the hiring party a notice of complaint warning that failure to timely answer will result in a rebuttable presumption that the hiring party violated FIFA (\u00a7\u00a7 20-931 [d], [e] [3]).<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>A complainant may also file a civil action in \"any court of competent jurisdiction\" (\u00a7 20-933 [a] [1]). A freelance worker who prevails on a claim alleging unlawful payment practices (as described in \u00a7 20-929) \"is entitled to an award for double damages, injunctive relief and other such remedies as may be appropriate\" under FIFA, as well as attorneys' fees and costs (\u00a7 20-933 [b] [1], [3]).<\/i><\/p><p><i>DISCUSSION<\/i><\/p>\n<p>On its appeal, RKC submits that Supreme Court should have dismissed Chen Inc.'s FIFA claim. Kozlovska cross-appeals from Supreme Court's dismissal of her claim against all defendants.<\/p>\n<p>When \"a defendant moves for dismissal of a cause of action under CPLR 3211 (a) (1), their documentary evidence must 'utterly refute[] the plaintiff's factual allegations, conclusively establishing a defense as a matter of law'\" (<i>Himmelstein, McConnell, Gribben, Donoghue &amp; Joseph, LLP v Matthew Bender &amp; Co.<\/i>, 37 NY3d 169, 175, quoting <i>Goshen v Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N.Y.<\/i>, 98 NY2d 314, 326 [2002]; <i>see also Balay v Manhattan 140 LLC<\/i>, 204 AD3d 491, 492-493 [1st Dept 2022] [\"The court should not have granted the Owner's cross motion to dismiss based on documentary evidence because the evidence submitted . . . did not conclusively establish a defense\"]).<\/p>\n<p>When considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211 [a] [7], \"we must give the pleadings a liberal construction, accept the allegations as true and accord the plaintiff[ ] every possible favorable inference\" (<i>Sassi v Mobile Life Support Servs., Inc.<\/i>, 37 NY3d 236, 239 [2021]). \"The question is whether the complaint adequately alleged facts giving rise to a cause of action\" (<i>id.<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>We decline to consider RKC's arguments because RKC did not move for dismissal of Chen Inc.'s FIFA claims before Supreme Court. We reinstate Kozlovska's claim as defendants failed to negate as a matter of law her contention that she is a freelance worker under FIFA.<\/p>\n<p>RKC argues that Supreme Court should have dismissed Chen Inc.'s FIFA claim pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (1) and (7) because documentary evidence [*4]established that Chen Inc. was not a freelance worker and therefore had no cause of action. In support, RKC points to the Photography Services Agreement stating that Chen Inc. would provide four people for the photoshoot, invoices for the overtime hours that Mr. Chen and his assistants worked, and Mr. Chen's OLPS complaint in which he stated that he was hired to work as part of a group of two or more people. These documents, RKC says, irrefutably showed that Chen Inc. fell outside of FIFA's definition of a freelance worker.<\/p>\n<p>In opposition, plaintiffs argue that Supreme Court properly denied RKC's motion as Chen Inc. was comprised solely of Mr. Chen and therefore fell within FIFA's definition of a freelance worker. Plaintiffs argue that the group of three additional workers for whom RKC and Chen Inc. contracted were other freelancers\u2014not Chen Inc.'s employees\u2014and that the documentary evidence offered by RKC did not conclusively prove otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>However, neither party mentions that RKC's motion to dismiss did not seek dismissal of Chen Inc.'s claim. As RKC did not seek such relief below, it cannot do so before us. Both Chen Inc. and Mr. Chen were named plaintiffs on the complaint, and RKC could have but did not move to dismiss Chen Inc.'s claim. Instead, RKC moved to dismiss only the claim brought by Mr. Chen individually and conceded that Chen Inc. was a distinct legal entity. In response, Mr. Chen voluntarily withdrew his claim. RKC now improperly and unconvincingly transposes its arguments against Mr. Chen individually to Chen Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Kozlovska argues that Supreme Court should not have dismissed her claim because she sufficiently pleaded a cause of action under FIFA, and defendants failed to furnish documentary evidence definitively disposing of her claim.<\/p>\n<p>RKC contends that they proved that Kozlovska was not a freelance worker through an invoice from VNY, VNY's entity listing with the New York Department of State, and Kozlovska's affidavit from a prior action. RKC maintains that Kozlovska was neither a freelance worker under FIFA nor in contractual privity with RKC because RKC and nonparty VNY had \"a continuing agreement\" under which VNY provided models \"on an 'as needed' basis.\" RKC also argues that Kozlovska had conceded in an affidavit that VNY entered into an agreement with RKC and issued an invoice to RKC, and that Kozlovska was not a party to either document. RKC further submits that Kozlovska was an employee of VNY rather than a freelance worker per the model booking agreement.<\/p>\n<p>These documents are not dispositive. The unpaid invoice and VNY's entity information do not conclusively establish that Kozlovska was an employee of VNY. While Kozlovska's affidavit from a prior action states that she was represented by an agency and that her agency communicated with defendants regarding outstanding payment, it also states that Kozlovska was considered a freelance worker and that she had a direct relationship with Keveza. The affidavit is therefore [*5]equivocal and is not determinative of whether Kozlovska was a freelance worker.<\/p>\n<p>While RKC references an agreement between itself and VNY, RKC did not furnish this agreement. RKC notes that Kozlovska indicated on her OLPS complaint form that she was hired as part of a group of two or more and that the \"[h]iring agreement was made through third party, my modeling agency.\" While it is unclear what OLPS's internal procedure is once it receives a complaint, OLPS continued to process the complaint and issued a rebuttable presumption in Kozlovska's favor despite these statements. Discovery could shed light on OLPS's process. The fact that OLPS issued a rebuttable presumption in Kozlovska's favor suggests that these statements were not fatal to her FIFA claim.<\/p>\n<p>FIFA's text is silent as to how to factor an agent into the calculus of whether someone is a freelance worker.<sup><b>[FN5]<\/b><\/sup> The Act does not mandate direct contracting between a freelance worker and the hiring party (<i>see<\/i> FIFA 20-927). While FIFA does not explicitly address its applicability to workers represented by agents, the plight of such workers was certainly before the City Council when it passed FIFA in the form of testimony from FIFA proponents in various industries sharing that freelance workers utilize agents. FIFA identifies specific categories of individual workers who are not freelancers under the Act. Notably, persons who are represented by an agent are not included in that finite list (<i>see<\/i> \u00a7 20-927).<\/p>\n<p>Given the inconclusive record before us, we cannot determine whether Kozlovska fell outside of FIFA's definition of a freelance worker at this early pleading stage. Therefore, Kozlovska's claim is reinstated, and the parties should engage in discovery to ascertain whether Kozlovska has a viable cause of action under FIFA. Discovery from OLPS may also illuminate this question, as deference may be warranted to an administrative agency's interpretation and \"specific application of a broad statutory term\" that it is charged with implementing (<i>Matter of O'Brien v Spitzer<\/i>, 7 NY3d 239, 242 [2006]; <i>see Matter of Peyton v New York City Bd. of Stds. &amp; Appeals<\/i>, 36 NY3d 271, 280 [2020] [deference to an agency is appropriate when interpretation is consistent with legislative intent, \"involves knowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices,\" and is \"neither irrational, unreasonable nor inconsistent with the governing statute\"]).<\/p>\n<p>For similar reasons, RKC's motion to dismiss Kozlovska's claim pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (3) and (7) should be denied. The record before us does not clearly support RKC's contention that Kozlovska lacks standing or lacks a cause of action under FIFA. Dismissal is therefore improper.<\/p>\n<p>Concerning the proper defendants for Kozlovska's claim, the \"hiring party\" here is unclear. The complaint alleged that Kozlovska furnished services to all defendants, and the documentary evidence submitted by defendants did not conclusively refute this allegation. Supreme Court therefore [*6]erred in dismissing Kozlovska's claims against all defendants. However, to the extent that Kozlovska relies on a veil-piercing theory to pierce RKC's corporate veil (as opposed to FIFA's definition of \"hiring party\"), the complaint failed to allege the necessary elements (<i>see Shisgal v Brown,<\/i> 21 AD3d 845, 848 [1st Dept 2005]).<\/p>\n<p>RKC argues that Supreme Court abused its discretion in denying its motion to vacate the default judgment pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (1). RKC claims that its failure to file responsive pleadings was due to its counsel's inadvertence. RKC submitted an affidavit from Keveza in which she stated that \"as we are headquartered in Toronto . . . and due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing many Toronto notarial locations, I had a great deal of difficulty finding a United States notary\" to notarize documents for the case. RKC further argues that it has a meritorious defense: Chen Inc. and Kozlovska were not freelance workers as defined in FIFA and therefore had no causes of action. Plaintiffs counter that RKC failed to establish entitlement to vacatur of the default judgment.<\/p>\n<p>It is well settled that \"[t]his State has a strong public policy for deciding cases on the merits\" (<i>US Bank N.A. v. Richards<\/i>, 155 AD3d 522, 523 [1st Dept 2017]). While RKC's counsel could have taken additional steps to notify Supreme Court of its purported difficulties in filing responsive pleadings, RKC ultimately filed pleadings. Further, the delay was not lengthy and Keveza's affidavit set forth a reasonable excuse for the delay. Moreover, as discussed above, it is unclear whether Kozlovska was a freelance worker under FIFA. It is therefore possible that RKC has a meritorious defense. Accordingly, Supreme Court erred in denying RKC's motion to vacate the default judgment.<\/p>\n<p>The parts of the orders dated May 28, June 10, June 17, and June 30 sanctioning defense counsel are not appealable as of right, as they did not result from motions made on notice (<i>see Sholes v Meagher,<\/i> 100 NY2d 333, 335 [2003]). Contrary to RKC's claim that it sought vacatur of the sanctions orders, the record indicates that it sought only vacatur of the part of the June 17 order granting Chen Inc.'s motion for a default judgment. Furthermore, even if we were to grant permission to appeal (<i>see<\/i> CPLR 5701 [c]) \u2014 although RKC does not request such relief \u2014 RKC lacks standing to appeal awards of sanctions against its counsel(<i>see Moore v Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.,<\/i> 94 AD3d 638, 639 [1st Dept 2012], <i>appeal dismissed<\/i> 19 NY3d 1065 [2012]).<\/p>\n<p>In light of the foregoing, defendants' remaining arguments are academic.<\/p>\n<p>Accordingly, the order of the Supreme Court, New York County (Nancy M. Bannon, J.), entered on or about March 11, 2021, which, to the extent appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied RKC's motion to dismiss Chen Inc.'s claim against it and granted defendants' motion to dismiss Kozlovska's claim against them, should be modified, on the law, to reinstate Kozlovska's claim against all defendants[*7], and otherwise affirmed, without costs. The order, same court and Justice, entered on or about June 30, 2021, to the extent that it denied RKC's motion to vacate the part of the order entered on or about June 17, 2021 granting Chen Inc. a default judgment, should be reversed, on the law, without costs, and the motion granted. The appeals from the orders entered on or about May 28, 2021, June 10, 2021, June 17, 2021, and June 30, 2021, to the extent that they denied RKC's motion for summary judgment on its first and fourth affirmative defenses, motion to renew the summary judgment motion, and motion and cross motion for leave to serve late responsive pleadings and\/or to compel Chen Inc.'s acceptance thereof, should be dismissed, without costs, as academic, and insofar as those orders imposed sanctions on defense counsel, dismissed, without costs, as taken from nonappealable orders.<\/p>\n<p>Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Nancy M.

Because the absence of this essential factual predicate means that any appellate court construction of former OCGA \u00a7 48-5-161(c)(2) would be advisory only, we accordingly reverse and remand this case to the Court of Appeals with direction that it vacate its holding in Division 1.<\/p>\n<p>1. It is well established that<\/p>\n<blockquote>Georgia law recognizes only two means of accomplishing a valid levy on real property. A levy on land may be accomplished by a simple entry on the fi. fa. by the levying officer. See OCGA \u00a7 9-13-12; <i>Isam v. Hooks,<\/i> 46 Ga. 309, 314-315 (1872). Notwithstanding this fact, a valid levy of an attachment upon real estate may also be accomplished by some overt act of constructive seizure. [Cit.] ... [A] constructive seizure may occur when there is the physical tacking of the notice of execution of levy on the real property in issue, resulting in a valid levy upon timely compliance with the notice requirements and other procedures set forth in the statutory scheme for tax sales.<\/blockquote>\n<p>(Citations and punctuation omitted.) <i>Powers v. CDSaxton Properties,<\/i> 285 Ga. 303, 304-305(1), 676 S.E.2d 186 (2009). Accord former OCGA \u00a7 48-5-161(c)(2). Although appellant, in asserting that the subject property was levied upon, points repeatedly to documents in the record reflecting unsigned and undated executions that were recorded in the execution docket,<sup>[1]<\/sup> the record clearly reflects that there is no official entry of levy by the levying officer on those documents, i.e., no signature accompanying a statement that the property identified on the execution had been levied upon. The law is clear that neither the mere issuance of a writ of execution nor its recordation without the official entry of levy can qualify as a valid levy. See <i>Powers,<\/i> supra.<\/p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals correctly recognized that the execution documents on which appellant relies did not show a valid levy occurred. <i>Harpagon Co.,<\/i> supra, 296 Ga.App. at 110(2), 673 S.E.2d 592. It next recognized properly that no levy occurred when a collection agent for Muscogee County was told to begin \"phase two\" of the collection process, id., as nothing in the record reflects a physical tacking of a valid notice of execution of levy on the real property in issue. See generally <i>Powers,<\/i> supra, 285 Ga. at 304-305(1), 676 S.E.2d 186.<sup>[2]<\/sup> Then, quoting Black's Law Dictionary and its definition of levy as \"`(t)he legally sanctioned seizure and sale of property' [cit.],\" <i>Harpagon Co.,<\/i> supra at 110(2), 673 S.E.2d 592, the Court of Appeals concluded that a levy \"is the actual sale itself\" of the property of a delinquent or defaulting taxpayer. Id. at 111(2), 673 S.E.2d 592. However, as stated above, there are only two means of accomplishing a levy in Georgia: by the official entry of levy on the execution or by some overt act of constructive seizure, i.e., posting on the property itself, \"prior to issuing the required notices, advertisements, and sale of the property.\" (Footnote omitted.) <i>Tharp v. Vesta Holdings I,<\/i> 276 Ga.App. 901, 903(1)(a), 625 S.E.2d 46 (2005). See also <i>Powers,<\/i> supra (tax sale set aside where no valid levy previously occurred); <i>Edward Kellogg &amp; Co. v. Buckler &amp; Short,<\/i> 17 Ga. 187, 191(3) (1855) (recognizing there must be a previous valid levy on land under execution for its sale to be valid). We thus disapprove the Court of Appeals' erroneous statement that the actual sale of property under execution is a levy.<\/p>\n<p>2. Appellant sought to collect the fees at issue here from appellee pursuant to former OCGA \u00a7 48-5-161(c)(2), which authorizes a sheriff or ex officio sheriff to collect certain denominated fees only \"[o]nce a levy is made or posted on the property of a delinquent or defaulting taxpayer.\" As we held above, the Court of Appeals correctly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*338<\/span> concluded no levy occurred in this case that would have authorized the collection of any fees set forth in that statute. However, because there was no valid levy, it follows that the fee discussion by the Court of Appeals constituted an improper advisory opinion in that the court attempted to determine in the abstract how this statute should be construed. \"Georgia appellate courts are not authorized to render advisory opinions as to potential error. [Cits.]\" <i>Bibbins v. State,<\/i> 280 Ga. 283, 284-285, 627 S.E.2d 29 (2006). See also <i>City of Atlanta v. Hotels.com,<\/i> 285 Ga. 231, n. 4, 674 S.E.2d 898 (2009) (this Court will not issue an advisory opinion). Accordingly, because the construction to be given the fees provision in OCGA \u00a7 48-5-161 was not properly before the Court of Appeals,<sup>[3]<\/sup> we reverse in part and remand this case to that court with direction that it vacate its advisory language.<\/p>\n<p><i>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed and remanded with direction in part.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>All the Justices concur.<\/p>\n<h2>NOTES<\/h2>\n<p>[1]  We express no opinion on the validity of the unsigned and undated \"executions\" in this case.<\/p>\n<p>[2]  As we held in <i>Powers,<\/i> supra at 305(1), 676 S.E.2d 186, the notice of levy required by OCGA \u00a7 48-3-9(a) does not substitute for a properly-executed fi. fa.<\/p>\n<p>[3]  We note that OCGA \u00a7 48-5-161 was amended in 2009.

The amendment added, inter alia, subsection (c)(2)(A), which provides that the \"costs\" collectible under the statute \"include[], but [are] not limited to, title examination expenses, certified mail expenses, reasonable attorney's fees, or other such necessary research expenses.\" Thus, it appears that the costs now enumerated in OCGA \u00a7 48-5-161(c)(2)(A) include the costs at issue in this case.

OCGA \u00a7 48-5-161 was further amended to change the point at which the costs could be collected; hence, collection \"[o]nce a levy is made or posted on the property of a delinquent or defaulting taxpayer,\" see former OCGA \u00a7 48-5-161(c)(2), is now collection \"[o]nce an execution is issued.\" OCGA \u00a7 48-5-161(c)(2)(B).

The plaintiff, Mickey Washington McGuire, a 33 year old black citizen, filed suit under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1113<\/span> 1343(3)<sup>[1]<\/sup> and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<sup>[2]<\/sup> against the defendants, the City of Nacogdoches and its Chief of Police, the Honorable M. C. Roebuck, on August 3, 1970. The suit sought, <i>inter alia,<\/i> a declaratory judgment that the parade ordinance relied upon by the police as justification for their action in breaking up the band of civil rights partisans is unconstitutional, an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance by the defendants, and the maintenance of the action as a class action. On motion of McGuire's counsel, the case was continued on three separate occasions, and eventually came to trial on April 10, 1972.<\/p>\n<p>In 1970 Nacogdoches was a city of about 22,500 population. The Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA), which lies within the municipal boundaries, had a student population of about 10,000. Racial bias and discriminatory practices associated with a segregated society are but slowly being eradicated in Nacogdoches. The black community in Nacogdoches, consisting of approximately 5,500 persons, is situated in a well-defined area called Orton Hill. Motion picture theaters were still segregated as late as 1969. The dual school system was not dismantled until 1970.<sup>[3]<\/sup> The county jail, which is situated in Nacogdoches, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1114<\/span> is still segregated. No black citizen has been elected in either municipal or county office in Nacogdoches County in modern times. One black unsuccessfully ran for the office of County Commissioner in 1959.<sup>[4]<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>McGuire, born and reared in Mobile, Alabama, was convicted of several felonies, involving burglary and larceny, when he was about 17 years of age. While incarcerated in the Alabama state prison system pursuant to his convictions, he managed to educate himself to some extent. In 1966, after having served six years' confinement, he obtained his release from prison by virtue of the writ of coram nobis, issued by an Alabama court. McGuire has no record of convictions since his release from prison.<\/p>\n<p>In April 1970, although he was not a student, McGuire was an organizer for the National Black Student Association. In the course of his organizational activities in Houston, Texas, McGuire met several black students from SFA, who invited him to organize a chapter of the National Black Students Association at SFA. McGuire accepted the invitation, and met with a warm reception at SFA among certain elements of the students and faculty. He discussed the rights and problems of blacks in several classes conducted by white professors, and also spoke to a number of groups in the black community.<\/p>\n<p>McGuire's arrival in Nacogdoches was duly reported to Chief Roebuck, who viewed the role of black militants and student activists in creating tumult and discord on the campuses and in the cities throughout the nation with extreme apprehension. Roebuck assigned a self-described \"conservative\" white SFA student named Russell Crawford (who volunteered to serve in an undercover capacity) to observe the movements and activities of McGuire.<sup>[5]<\/sup> Roebuck also requested information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning McGuire, and was subsequently furnished by it with a copy of McGuire's \"rap sheet\".<\/p>\n<p>On April 24, 1970, a black female student, Cubie Nell Dorsey, was arrested by city policemen on the campus of SFA and charged with the offenses of forgery and passing of a check at a Nacogdoches store.<sup>[6]<\/sup> Although he was not acquainted with Miss Dorsey, McGuire proceeded to intervene with the police, in an effort to see that her rights were protected. Immediately following her arrest, McGuire engaged in abrasive conversations concerning Miss Dorsey with the arresting officers on the campus at SFA, and later with Roebuck at the police station.<sup>[7]<\/sup> Finally, he attempted to be present, as an observer, at her initial appearance before a magistrate, where she was to be informed of her legal rights.<\/p>\n<p>The hearing before the magistrate, the Honorable Carl Burrows, then Justice of the Peace, was conducted in a small courtroom in the Nacogdoches County Courthouse. McGuire and several of his followers appeared at the hallway <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1115<\/span> entrance to the courtroom, and McGuire knocked loudly on the closed courtroom door. Upon instructions from the Justice of the Peace, Roebuck directed McGuire and those who accompanied him to leave the premises. McGuire and the others, complaining loudly, reluctantly complied with the request.<\/p>\n<p>The arrest of Miss Dorsey triggered the inception of about 15 demonstrations, inspired by McGuire, in the main business section of the city. Black citizens of Nacogdoches and black and white students from SFA participated in the demonstrations. The demonstrators, who appear to have ranged in number from five to twenty at a time, carried signs and placards indicating discontent with the lot of blacks in Nacogdoches.<sup>[8]<\/sup> All of the demonstrations were conducted on the sidewalks, in the daytime, and were entirely orderly and peaceful. The police made no effort to interfere with the picketing, aside from taking still photographs and moving pictures of the participants. When the sidewalk demonstrations began, Chief Roebuck, manifestly alarmed by them, requested the Department of Public Safety to furnish additional personnel to the Nacogdoches area for emergency use. Thirty extra patrolmen were assigned by the Department of Public Safety to Nacogdoches on April 25, 1970, and thereafter on a daily basis through May 13, 1970.<\/p>\n<p>On May 4, 1970, several students were killed by National Guard troops at Kent State University in Ohio, which precipitated demonstrations by students on the campuses of colleges and universities all over the United States. A few days before May 13, 1970, in memorium to the dead students at Kent State, white and black students of SFA conducted a large so-called \"candlelight march\" between the campus and the main business quarter of Nacogdoches. This march was made entirely on the sidewalks bordering North-South Street (State Highway No. 59), the main-traveled street in Nacogdoches. The Kent State incident and the related demonstrations, local and nationwide, reenforced Chief Roebuck's fears of widespread revolutionary activities in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>On May 11, 1970, two black SFA students planned another candlelight march for the night of May 13, 1970, to demonstrate \"a spirit of brotherhood between black and white citizens of Nacogdoches.\" On the night of May 13, a group of black and white students met in the home of Helena Patton, a black student, in the Orton Hill area of Nacogdoches. McGuire, who had been out of the city, arrived at the Patton home immediately before the beginning of the march. The leadership of the procession intended that it should proceed from the Patton home to the Federal Building, located in the main business portion of Nacogdoches, and then return to the point of origin. The procession was planned and executed as a columnar formation, complete with parade marshals to keep the column in order. At the inception of the demonstration, the participants marched, five abreast, through the streets of the Orton Hill district.<sup>[9]<\/sup> As it wound its way through the Orton Hill area, numerous other blacks joined the procession until it numbered about 250.<\/p>\n<p>The column of demonstrators left the Orton Hill area by way of Shawnee Street, proceeding in a northerly direction. When the column arrived at East Main Street, which leads to the main business sector of the city, it turned west. The demonstrators obeyed the traffic signals at the intersection, and no traffic was blocked. After turning west onto East Main Street, the demonstrators, still in a well-controlled column, stayed largely on the sidewalks on the north side of the street, although there was some overflow onto the part of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1116<\/span> street marked by painted lines for the diagonal parking of vehicles. At the time, the demonstrators were singing patriotic songs and spirituals and chanting slogans identified with the nonviolent civil rights movement in the Southern states. Their mood was described as \"happy\", and the demonstration was orderly.<\/p>\n<p>Proceeding west along East Main Street, the procession crossed Lanana, Walker, Mound and Church Streets. East Main Street is four lanes in width as far as Mound Street, where it narrows to two lanes. There was no obstruction of traffic by the demonstrators as far as Mound Street; but by reason of the narrowing of the street at that point, the north lane of traffic was partially obstructed by the marchers, after they passed Mound Street. Nevertheless, the normal flow of traffic was not materially interfered with by the marchers.<\/p>\n<p>When the column reached the main business portion of town, near the vicinity of Mound and Church Streets, vehicular traffic was light. It was approximately 9:00 o'clock p. m., and none of the business firms were open, except for a business college on the second floor of a building overlooking East Main Street. After the demonstrators passed Church Street, but before they reached the next street, Fredonia, they were turned back by members of the Nacogdoches police force and other law enforcement officers.<\/p>\n<p>The demonstrators had been observed by a black member of the police force at the intersection of Shawnee and East Main Street. This policeman drove to the police station, located one block south of East Main Street on Fredonia Street, where he notified patrolman Smith Parmer of the march. Parmer communicated with Chief Roebuck by telephone; and other law enforcement personnel were immediately notified of the demonstration by police radio dispatchers. Parmer then sped in his police vehicle to the head of the procession, where McGuire was in the lead. Although no violence or disruptions had attended the march up to this point, except for the noise made by the demonstrators in singing and chanting, Parmer peremptorily directed McGuire and the rest of the demonstrators to turn back. Parmer's commands were ignored, and he thereupon arrested, at gunpoint, McGuire and another black, one Willie Wade, who were immediately transported to the City Jail of Nacogdoches in a police vehicle. During the period while McGuire and Wade were being arrested, and after their departure, the marchers surged forward and partially blocked East Main Street.<\/p>\n<p>Numerous law enforcement officers, including Chief Roebuck, Texas Department of Public Safety personnel, and members of the staff of the Sheriff of Nacogdoches County, had by this time arrived on the scene. In response to commands from the police and other law enforcement officers, and also in reaction to directions from their parade marshals, the demonstrators returned to the raised sidewalks on the north side of East Main Street and proceeded east. To hasten the marchers along their way to the sidewalks and to the east, a few of the police officers present resorted to the indiscriminate use of mace. Other force was used by the law enforcement officers, but there were no serious injuries inflicted on any of the demonstrators or the officers.<\/p>\n<p>The dispositions of certain of the marchers apparently turned ugly as they proceeded toward Shawnee Street, and two trash cans were overturned. When they reached the intersection of East Main Street and Shawnee Street, the demonstrators congregated on a vacant lot, and a number cursed and threw rocks and bottles at the peace officers confronting them. The plate glass windows of two business establishments were broken, as well as several automobile windshields, and a wooden boat next to a store was set on fire; but the identity of the demonstrators involved in the various acts of vandalism was not established.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1117<\/span> The demonstrators were then driven back onto Shawnee Street and into the Orton Hill vicinity by peace officers, where they reassembled at the home of Helena Patton, the point from which the march had originated. A new leader, Rufus Woodrow, a black athlete at SFA, rallied the dispirited demonstrators, and they again attempted to march from the Orton Hill area into the white part of the city. A phalanx of heavily armed peace officers blocked their departure, however, at each of the several exits from the Orton Hill community. On one of these occasions, another rock throwing incident occurred. However, Woodrow managed to stop the activities of the overwrought rock throwers, and no other acts of violence accompanied the marches. Eventually, the peace officers permitted the demonstrators to disperse and return to their homes without further embroilment.<\/p>\n<p>McGuire remained at the City Jail for about one hour. He was then taken to the County Jail at Nacogdoches County, two blocks away, accompanied by a large contingent of armed law enforcement officers and approximately five police vehicles. McGuire remained, incommunicado, in the County Jail until May 15, 1970, at about 8:00 a. m., when he was taken before Carl Burrows, the Justice of the Peace. Burrows set bail on five misdemeanor charges, which had been filed against McGuire in the County Court of Nacogdoches County on May 14, 1970, in the total sum of $105,000.<sup>[10]<\/sup> He had never before set bail as high as this in any misdemeanor cases.<\/p>\n<p>The judge of the Corporation Court, the Honorable H. W. Whitten, was also present on this occasion. Judge Whitten informed McGuire that he was charged with the violation of two ordinances of the City of Nacogdoches, and bail was set at $1,000.00 for each offense. One of the complaints in the Corporation Court charged McGuire with a violation of Section 21-37 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Nacogdoches. The ordinance in question, which was adopted on August 9, 1965, is set out in the margin.<sup>[11]<\/sup> After the hearings before the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1118<\/span> Justice of the Peace and the City Judge, McGuire was returned to the Nacogdoches County Jail, where he remained for about one week. The Honorable George Middlebrook, at that time the County Judge of Nacogdoches County, then revoked the orders of the Justice of the Peace setting bail for McGuire, and lowered the bail to a total of $7,500. McGuire subsequently made bail for both the state and city offenses charged against him.<\/p>\n<p>McGuire left the City of Nacogdoches some months after his arrest. He had not been brought to trial for any of the offenses charged against him in either the County Court of Nacogdoches County or the Municipal Court of the City of Nacogdoches at the time of the trial of the instant case. A few sidewalk demonstrations by blacks occurred in Nacogdoches in the days following the arrest of McGuire on May 13, 1970; but no street processions or sidewalk demonstrations of any type have taken place since that time.<\/p>\n<p>Since McGuire is seeking a declaratory judgment that the procession ordinance which he is charged with violating in the Corporation Court of the City of Nacogdoches is unconstitutional, the Court is confronted with the decision of the Supreme Court in Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L. Ed.2d 688 (1971). It was there held that where a state prosecution is pending, \"the same equitable principles relevant to the propriety of an injunction must be taken into consideration by federal district courts in determining whether to issue a declaratory judgment.\" Thus, if an injunction would be impermissible under the circumstances, \"declaratory relief should ordinarily be denied as well.\" <i>Id.,<\/i> at 73, 91 S.Ct. at 768.<\/p>\n<p>Until the Supreme Court decided Mitchum v. Foster, 1972, 407 U.S. 225, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705, one posited obstacle to injunctive relief in suits brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, was the federal anti-injunction act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283, which provides that a federal court may not enjoin state court proceedings \"except as authorized by Act of Congress.\" In <i>Mitchum,<\/i> it was decided that \u00a7 1983 is within that exception; but the court was at pains to emphasize that it did not \". . . question or qualify in any way the principles of equity, comity, and federalism that must restrain a federal court when asked to enjoin a state court proceeding.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 243, 92 S.Ct. at 2163.<\/p>\n<p>These principles were dealt with at length in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669, and its companion cases, insofar as they dealt with pending state prosecutions.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"In <i>Younger,<\/i> [the Supreme Court] emphatically reaffirmed `the fundamental policy against federal interference with state criminal prosecutions.' 401 U.S., at 46, 91 S.Ct. [746.] at 751. It made clear that even `the possible unconstitutionality of a statute \"on its face\" does not in itself justify an injunction against good faith attempts to enforce it.' 401 U.S., at 54, 91 S. Ct. [746] at 755. At the same time, however, the Court clearly left room for federal injunctive intervention in a pending state court prosecution in certain exceptional circumstances\u0097where irreparable injury is both `great and immediate,' 401 U.S., at 46, 91 S.Ct. [746,] at 751, where the state law is `flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions,' 401 U.S., at 53, 91 S.Ct. [746,] at 755, or where there is a showing of `bad faith, harassment, or . . . other unusual circumstances that would call for equitable relief.' 401 U.S., at 54, 91 S.Ct. [746] at 755,\" Mitchum v. Foster, <i>supra,<\/i> 407 U.S., at 230, 92 S.Ct., at 2156.<\/blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1119<\/span> The defendants rely upon the ordinance adopted on August 9, 1965 (relating to processions upon the streets of Nacogdoches), as a justification for the actions of the police in forcibly disbanding the demonstrators. It is undisputed that the demonstrators did not apply for a permit to conduct a procession, as required by the ordinance. The first question, then, is whether it is \"flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"The right to use a public place for expressive activity may be restricted only for weighty reasons,\" Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2303, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972), and any system of prior restraints of expression comes to a federal court \"bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.\" Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70, 83 S.Ct. 631, 639, 9 L.Ed.2d 584. In particular, expressive activity relating to the use of the streets of a municipality is entitled to First Amendment protection, for<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"[w]herever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for the purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens.\" Hague v. C. I. O., 307 U.S. 496, 515-516, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423.<\/blockquote>\n<p>The City obviously failed to overcome the presumption against the constitutionality of the ordinance of August 9, 1965. The ordinance conferred upon the City Manager exclusive and unrestrained authority to grant or deny permits to conduct parades and processions on the streets of Nacogdoches and did not, even colorably, purport to impose any standards to guide the City Manager in his decision-making process. Numerous decisions of the Supreme Court and lower courts have invalidated ordinances which give authority to a public official to sanction or prohibit, at will, the exercise of expressive activity. Thus, in Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 150-151, 89 S.Ct. 935, 939, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969), it was held:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"[A] law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional. `It is settled . . . that an ordinance which, like this one, makes the peaceful enjoyment of freedoms which the Constitution guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled will of an official\u0097as by requiring a permit or license which may be granted or withheld in the discretion of such official\u0097is an unconstitutional censorship or prior restraint upon the enjoyment of those freedoms.' Staub v. Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 322, 78 S.Ct. 277, 282, 2 L.Ed.2d 302.\"<sup>[12]<\/sup><\/blockquote>\n<p>Defendants point to the fact that the City Manager had granted 65 permits and had never refused to issue a permit for a procession, up to and including May 13, 1970. The defendants contend that \"[t]he only requirement was that the paraders (demonstrators) should check with the police department to arrange the route and for police supervision in order to insure the proper flow of traffic and proper observation of the law.\" They apparently suggest, therefore, that a construction was placed on the ordinance by the City which is binding upon this court. This contention ignores the holdings of the Fifth Circuit in Anderson v. Nosser, 438 F.2d 183, 194 (5 Cir. 1971), Strother v. Thompson, 372 F.2d 654 (5 Cir. 1967), and Guyot v. Pierce, 372 F.2d 658 (5 Cir. 1967). Cf. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1120<\/span> Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 556-558, 85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965).<\/p>\n<p>In <i>Guyot, supra,<\/i> 372 F.2d, at 662, the court stated:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"The undisputed proof in the record from a responsible police official is:<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`That the City Council in arriving at its decision [as to granting permits] considered the following problems: Traffic control along the proposed parade or march route; the size and number, length, number of vehicles, etc. that would be in the parade; the number of police and police vehicles that would be needed or required to handle the proposed parade; the time element in connection with any such proposed parade in order that such parade would not interfere with the normal flow of traffic.'<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"This witness testified that the only reason for requiring a permit was in order that traffic could be controlled and law and order maintained during the parade.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"These are, of course, objects of legitimate municipal concern, which, as already pointed out, the City clearly has the authority to handle in a constitutional manner.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The difficulty is that these standards and considerations do not appear in the face of the Ordinance.\"<\/blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, <i>id.,<\/i> at 660, the court pointed out that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"[D]uring the three year period immediately preceding this attempted parade without a permit there had been 13 parade permit applications filed in the City of Jackson and none had been denied. Almost half of those granted were for Negroes and\/or civil rights demonstrations.\"<\/blockquote>\n<p>In Strother v. Thompson, supra, 372 F.2d, at 657, the court held:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"We can find nothing in the ordinance which requires the Council to issue a license. The ordinance carries no command to grant an application, neither does it prescribe the criteria or standards upon which an application is to be denied. * * * [W]hen the ordinance is altogether silent as to when and under what circumstances the permit shall or shall not be granted, then there is no way to find out what would constitute legal discretion. Only unfettered power remains.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"We are, therefore, of the opinion that this ordinance is indeed unconstitutional on its face and cannot be squared with constitutional guarantees.\"<\/blockquote>\n<p>This court has not been directed to any decision by the state courts which has construed the ordinance and \"defined the limitations of the authority conferred for the granting of licenses for parade and processions\", as was the case in Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 575, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941). It is not within the power of this court to thus narrow the ordinance. United States v. 37 Photographs, 402 U. S. 363, 369, 91 S.Ct. 1400, 28 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971). Hence, because of its failure to set any standards whatsoever to guide the licensing authority, the ordinance is patently and flagrantly unconstitutional on its face.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants maintain that since the plaintiffs made no effort to comply with the provisions of the ordinance which required a permit for a procession, they are not entitled to complain of its unconstitutionality. But this contention had been foreclosed by Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, supra, 394 U.S., at 151, 89 S.Ct., at 939, and the cases cited there, where it was declared that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"[O]ur decisions have made clear that a person faced with such an unconstitutional licensing law may ignore it and engage with impunity in the exercise of the right of free expression for which the law purports to require a license.\"<\/blockquote>\n<p>Considering the invalidity of the ordinance of August 9, 1965, it is thus clear that McGuire and other black and white dissidents in Nacogdoches were entitled to the free expression of their ideas on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1121<\/span> the streets of Nacogdoches, even though their views were regarded with hostility and apprehension by the Chief of Police and other officials. As said in Robinson v. Coopwood, 292 F.Supp. 926, 934 (N. D.Miss.1968), aff'd 415 F.2d 1377 (5 Cir. 1969):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"The exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly cannot be made a crime, nor may those who seek to freely exercise those rights be criminally punished for failure to previously register their intentions with law enforcement officers, in absence of a situation involving clear and present violence, or threat thereof.\"<\/blockquote>\n<p>The record in this case abundantly demonstrates that, until it was broken up by law officers, no such clear and present danger of violence or disruption existed in connection with the march in issue. It was conducted at a time when automotive traffic was light in the main business section of town, and the marchers were orderly and well behaved until routed by law officers. Certainly the minor inconvenience to traffic occasioned by the march could not validly be equated with a \"serious substantive evil.\" Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131. The extensive picketing activities in the business area of Nacogdoches had failed to produce any disturbances which would qualify as threats to the public order or safety; and the first candlelight march likewise did not result in rioting or other unlawful activities by the participants. In view of these circumstances, the police and other officers of the law were not legally warranted in preventing the march on the basis of threatened public disorders, for \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression.\" Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503, at 508, 89 S.Ct. 733, at 737, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969).<\/p>\n<p>An arguable case may be made that the original ordinance of August 9, 1965, is invalid, also, because of its discriminatory enforcement by the police, <i>i. e.,<\/i> demonstrations by college students in celebration of victories by the SFA basketball team were not disturbed by the police, even though no demonstration permits were applied for or granted. Cox v. Louisiana, <i>supra,<\/i> 379 U.S., at 557, 85 S.Ct. 453. But see Robinson v. Coopwood, <i>supra,<\/i> 292 F.Supp., at 934. It may also be contended that both the original ordinance and the amended ordinance, hereafter referred to, are unconstitutional, because they make distinctions between peaceful funeral processions and military marches, on the one hand, and other peaceful demonstrations, on the other hand. Police Department of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972); Grayned v. City of Rockford, <i>supra<\/i><i>.<\/i> However, a decision on these postulated grounds for invalidity of the ordinances is not necessary, and they will not be considered further.<\/p>\n<p>There remains for consideration whether the existing prosecution of McGuire for a violation of the original procession ordinance is in bad faith and without hope of obtaining a valid conviction. Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82, 85, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). The attorneys for defendants, demonstrating a remarkable lack of candor with the court, have refused to acknowledge the unconstitutionality of the challenged ordinance; but the members of the City Commission have tacitly done so, <i>i. e.,<\/i> by making reference to the \"possibility of the unconstitutionality\" of the original ordinance in the recitations preceding their passage of the amended ordinance. However, there are other considerations affecting this court's conclusion of the existence of bad faith prosecution which are of more weight.<\/p>\n<p>The following colloquy between the court and the Honorable S. M. Adams, City Attorney of Nacogdoches, is quoted from the record:<\/p>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: * * * Perhaps the City Attorney, who is present here in court, may tell me what the disposition of the city is toward any prosecution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1122<\/span> that might be contemplated against the Plaintiff at this time.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. ADAMS: Judge, I can speak now for that as City Attorney. I have been in contact, not recently but some time ago, with the County and District Attorney, and I was abiding their decision in the matter.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: You are going to do whatever they do?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. ADAMS: Yes, sir.<\/blockquote>\n<p>A reference to the testimony of the District Attorney and the County Attorney, taken by deposition at the request of the Court, is revealing. The District Attorney, the Honorable David Adams, testified that he had no role, function, responsibility, or duties in the County Court of Nacogdoches County; that he prosecuted only in the District Courts; and that he had not presented to any grand jury any case of felony grade against McGuire for indictment, and knew of none to present.<\/p>\n<p>The following are extracts from the testimony of the Honorable Bryan Davis, County Attorney of Nacogdoches County:<\/p>\n<p>[Questions by Mr. Watts, attorney for the plaintiff:]<\/p>\n<blockquote>Q. How long have you been County Attorney of Nacogdoches County, Texas?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Since 1966.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>*   *   *   *   *   *<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Are you the prosecutor in the County Court of Nacogdoches County?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, sir.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And those complaints [against McGuire], if they are to be prosecuted, are to be prosecuted by you. Is that correct?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, I have sole responsibility for that.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Have those complaints been dismissed, at this time?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Are those complaints still active, pending trial?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, they are.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What are your responsibilities and duties regarding the calling of cases for trial in the County Court of Nacogdoches County?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I have no responsibility, of course, for setting the docket of the court.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Who sets the docket?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. The judge, the County Judge.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Has that been true since May 14th of 1970?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And who is the County Judge of Nacogdoches County, Texas?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. The County Judge is Carl S. Burrows.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And do you know how long Carl Burrows has been County Judge in Nacogdoches County?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. He has been in approximately two years. Two years this January.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Did he become County Judge of Nacogdoches County, pursuant to a run-off election held in June of 1970?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. He did.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And it is his sole responsibility to select the cases that will be placed upon the trial docket and to call those cases for trial in Nacogdoches County Court?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Do you know what the intentions are of the Court, at this time, for calling the five complaints lodged against Mr. McGuire, in that Court are, regarding trial or disposition of those causes?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No, sir. I do not, so far as being able to speak for the Court. What the Court's intentions are in the matter, I couldn't say.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What are your intentions regarding those complaints?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. My intentions at the present time are to treat them as I treat most of our other cases which are active pending cases on the docket. That is simply to, if asked by the Judge what my opinion is about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1123<\/span> setting them, I would give him my opinion.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What would your opinion be if he were to inquire?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. My opinion at this time would be . . . my personal opinion would be that it would serve no good end at this time, to try the cases.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Would it be your opinion or your recommendation to dismiss them?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. It would be your recommendation to simply hold them in abeyance until you felt the proper time had arrived for trial of those cases?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, sir.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>*   *   *   *   *   *<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. I would like to ask you this, since you testified a moment ago when Mr. Potter asked you the question regarding whether or not a fair and impartial trial could have occurred, immediately succeeding the filing of these complaints against Mr. McGuire, in the County Court and you said it was your opinion because of the air of emotionalism that prevailed at that time\u0097let me ask you this, do you think that that same attitude of emotionalism prevails at this date?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Since Mr. McGuire has removed himself from our midst, I don't feel that we have such tension as we had then. I think that we have a good deal left. I am not satisfied yet that there is such an absence of it that at this time, I would want to try the cases.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Judge Burrow's testimony was also taken by deposition at the direction of this court. A portion of it is as follows:<\/p>\n<p>[Questions by Mr. Watts, attorney for plaintiff:]<\/p>\n<blockquote>Q. You have one week for criminal trials per each 4-months session.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, sir.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And you have been County Judge now since January the 1st, 1971.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Right.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. To your knowledge, have any of these five criminal charges pending against Mr. McGuire been set for trial in County Court?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Have they ever been placed on any docket, any criminal docket in County Court?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. You mean before I went in there?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Since you have taken office?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Now, who in the County Court's office, either the clerk's or your office as County Judge, designates which criminal cases will be set for trial during the sessions per year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Me and the County Attorney.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. The County Attorney participates in that with you.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Does he actually take the lead or do you take the lead?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, both of us.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You consult with him which cases should be tried?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Have you had occasion to consult with him about setting any of these five cases charged against Mr. McGuire for trial?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No. Let me tell you something. When I went in office in 1971, there was a large backlog of cases on the docket. There hadn't been over a dozen cases tried in County Court in the last eight years.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Are you saying that these cases pending against Mr. McGuire have not been set for trial because of the backlog?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. We haven't caught up to them.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. When do you expect to catch up to them?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Maybe this Fall.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1124<\/span> Q. Do you have plans at this time for setting these cases for trial?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No specific plans.<\/blockquote>\n<p>[Questions by Mr. Potter, attorney for defendants:]<\/p>\n<blockquote>Q. Now, you have been asked by counsel when do you anticipate setting these cases. What do you intend to do about setting these cases? I'm asking you the same question.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I would like to try these cases some time this year.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Now, Judge Burrows, do you appreciate that a defendant is entitled to have his case tried?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Oh, yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Are you an attorney?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You do understand that a defendant is entitled to have his case tried?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And you say you would like to try them this year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Well, do you propose to do it this year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, if it is agreeable with the County Attorney.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. In other words, you are the judge of the court and you are the one to say whether you are going to try the case, or not. What if it is not agreeable with him? Are you going to try the cases this year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. If he is not agreeable and wouldn't, how could I?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Well, you can either try cases or you can dismiss them. You can dispose of the case, you see. Are you going to set the cases down and try them?<\/blockquote>\n<p>MR. WATTS: Let the witness say what he's going to do.<\/p>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, I will set them down.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. I mean do you intend to set the cases down this year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Now, when they are set down, at that time if the County Attorney is not ready, and I'm not asking you to pre-judge them or to say now what you are going to do at that time, but if you do set them down this year, will you decide at that time whether you are going to put the County Attorney to trial whether he wants to try them, or not. Otherwise, I want you to have this advise: That it is for the Judge to decide what he is going to do with the case when he sets it for trial and not the County Attorney.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, knowing the County Attorney like I do and the respect I have for him, I think he would respect my wishes enough to try the cases.<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is implicit from the statement of the County Attorney and the foregoing testimony that the City Attorney and the County Attorney entered into an agreement, tacit or otherwise, that so long as McGuire absented himself from Nacogdoches, neither would make any effort to bring him to trial, and this court so finds. Assuming McGuire's continued nonpresence in Nacogdoches, it is doubtful that the County Court prosecutions directed against him would ever have occurred, taking into account the fact that the lay County Judge was not cognizant of his power to set and to try cases without the concurrence of the County Attorney. Hence, it is this court's opinion that the bona fides of the prosecutions against McGuire in the County Court is subject to question.<\/p>\n<p>But regardless of the status of the prosecutions in County Court, the question before the court at this juncture is whether the prosecution in Corporation Court is being conducted in good faith. The City Attorney advanced no explanation or rationalization for his determination that he would abide by the decision of the County Attorney and the District Attorney respecting McGuire's continued prosecution in the Corporation Court, nor is this court able <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1125<\/span> to perceive any valid reason or justification for his decision. On the contrary, this court finds that the City Attorney is fully aware of the constitutional invalidity of the original procession ordinance, and that the purpose and effect of his failure to move for the dismissal of the charge against McGuire was and is to intimidate, threaten and coerce other blacks from exercising their constitutional rights to free speech and assembly. Duncan v. Perez, 321 F.Supp. 181, 184-185 (E.D.La.1970), aff'd 445 F.2d 557 (5 Cir. 1971); United States v. McLeod, 385 F.2d 734, 744-745 (5 Cir. 1967).<\/p>\n<p>Considering the glaring and evident unconstitutionality of the ordinance of August 9, 1965, and the bad faith prosecution of McGuire in the Corporation Court, the prerequisites of Samuels v. Mackell, <i>supra<\/i><i>,<\/i> have been met, and a declaration of the invalidity of the ordinance is proper. There is still left for resolution, however, the other contentions of the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>Defendants argue that this action has been mooted, because: (1) McGuire no longer resides in Nacogdoches; (2) McGuire is not now an organizer for the National Black Students Association; (3) Nacogdoches is now quiet and orderly, there having been no demonstrations on its streets or sidewalks since McGuire left the city; and (4) a new ordinance relating to processions was adopted by the City Commission of the City of Nacogdoches on September 22, 1971.<\/p>\n<p>The finding of a bad faith prosecution establishes irreparable injury to McGuire, both great and immediate, for purposes of the comity restraints discussed in <i>Younger.<\/i> Shaw v. Garrison, 467 F.2d 113 (5 Cir. 1972). This harm to McGuire remains impendent and unsoftened, regardless of his present residence or occupation, and without respect to the present state of public order in Nacogdoches. It is thus unrealistic to assert that the controversy is moot as to McGuire.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, with reference to the third argument, it should be noted that this action is maintainable as a class action, the members of the class being those persons in Nacogdoches who desire to demonstrate lawfully on the streets of that city in behalf of civil rights for blacks. Jenkins v. United Gas Corp., 400 F.2d 28, 34 (5 Cir. 1968). See also: Advisory Committee's Note to Subdivision (b)(2), of 23 F.R.Civ.P., and cases there cited.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he class suit is a uniquely appropriate procedure in civil rights cases, which generally involve an allegation of discrimination against a group as well as the violation of rights of particular individuals. Moreover, by their very nature civil rights class actions almost invariably involve a plaintiff class.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>*   *   *   *   *   *<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The doctrine of mootness is tied to the concern that once a plaintiff loses his right to relief the court, in effect, will be rendering an advisory opinion if it continues since no actual controversy is before it. But this reasoning does not apply in the class action context, because the fact that some members of the class no longer are subject to the alleged discrimination does not destroy the existence of a controversy between defendant and the remaining class members. Indeed, to hold otherwise would enable defendant to circumvent the public policies against discrimination on the grounds of race or sex by `buying off' or satisfying individual claimants.\" Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil Sec. 1776.<\/blockquote>\n<p>To hold otherwise would, under certain circumstances, also enable a defendant to \"scare off\" an individual plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>The circumstances of this case \u0097the history of systematic racial discrimination in Nacogdoches; the harsh measures employed by the police and other officers to break up the march of May 13, 1970; the filing of numerous <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1126<\/span> criminal complaints against the chief actor, McGuire, by city police; the bad faith prosecution of McGuire by the City Attorney; the evident agreement between the prosecuting attorneys for the City and State to hold criminal charges over McGuire's head, to induce him to refrain from returning to Nacogdoches; the personal hostility evidenced by the Chief of Police toward McGuire and other black militants; and, finally, the fact that no further marches on the streets of Nacogdoches have occurred, although blacks and students in Nacogdoches continue the civil rights ferment<sup>[13]<\/sup>\u0097all compel the conclusion and finding of this court that enforcement by the City of the unconstitutional ordinance of August 9, 1965, has effectively and continuously operated to intimidate, deter, and inhibit, and presently intimidates, deters, and inhibits, the affected class from exercising their rights, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, to free speech and assembly on the streets of Nacogdoches. Duncan v. Perez, <i>supra,<\/i> 321 F.Supp., at 184-185, 445 F. 2d, at 560; United States v. McLeod, <i>supra,<\/i> 385 F.2d at 744-745.<\/p>\n<p>The rights of the affected class are not in issue in McGuire's prosecution in the Corporation Court, and remedies available to him in his trial are in no way available to the affected class. Neither could the rights of the non-litigants in the criminal trial be represented in the state appellate process or by direct Supreme Court review. In view of these considerations, irreparable injury to the affected class is present here. Duncan v. Perez, <i>supra,<\/i> 321 F.Supp., at 185, 445 F.2d, at 560; United States v. McLeod, <i>supra,<\/i> 385 F.2d, at 746-747; United States v. Wood, 295 F.2d 772, 781 (5 Cir. 1961). <i>Cf.<\/i> Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L. Ed.2d 22 (1965); Reed v. Giarrusso, 462 F.2d 706 (5 Cir. 1972). To hold otherwise would mean that \"free expression \u0097of transcendent value to all society, and not merely to those exercising their rights\u0097might be the loser.\" Dombrowski v. Pfister, <i>supra,<\/i> 380 U.S., at 486, 85 S.Ct., at 1121.<\/p>\n<p>As previously indicated, defendants base their final argument as to mootness on the fact that on September 22, 1971, after this suit was instituted, the City Commission of Nacogdoches voluntarily adopted an amended ordinance governing street and sidewalk processions. The terms of the amended ordinance are set forth in the margin.<sup>[14]<\/sup> The defendants maintain the constitutionality of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1127<\/span> the amended ordinance, and argue that the action of the City Commission in voluntarily adopting it demonstrates that the City will hereafter follow constitutional procedures in granting or denying permits for processions. But, as stated in United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"[V]oluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case, <i>i. e.,<\/i> does not make the case moot. * * * A controversy may remain to be settled in such circumstances, . . . <i>e. g.,<\/i> a dispute over the legality of the challenged practices. * * * The defendant is free to return to his old ways. This, together with the public interest in having the legality of the practices settled, militates against a mootness conclusion. * * * For to say that the case has become moot means that the defendant is entitled to a dismissal as a matter of right. * * * The courts have rightly refused to grant defendants such a powerful weapon against public law enforcement.\" (Citations omitted.)<\/blockquote>\n<p>In this regard, the defendants have adamantly and consistently asserted that the ordinance of August 9, 1965, is constitutional, although closely pressed by the court to admit the contrary. This obstinate and obdurate attitude on the part of the defendants emphasizes that, \"[w]hat has been adopted can be repealed.\" Anderson v. City of Albany, 321 F.2d 649, 657 (5 Cir. 1963). <i>Cf.<\/i> Bailey v. Patterson, 323 F.2d 201, 205 (5 Cir. 1963). Moreover, \"[i]t is the duty of the courts to beware of efforts to defeat injunctive relief by protestations of repentance and reform especially when abandonment seems timed to anticipate suit, and there is probability of resumption.\" United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, 343 U.S. 326, 333, 72 S.Ct. 690, 696, 96 L.Ed. 978 (1952). If past history is a guide to future conduct, the Nacogdoches police will probably be permitted to enforce the amended procession ordinance, even though its constitutionality may legitimately be called into question.<\/p>\n<p>The court is not empowered to make a declaration of the constitutionality <i>vel non<\/i> of the amended ordinance, because there are no pending or threatened criminal prosecutions under it. Becker v. Thompson, 459 F.2d 919 (5 Cir. 1972). However, in view of the defendants' profession that the adoption of the amended ordinance has had the effect of mooting this action, the court has made a preliminary examination of the validity of defendants' contention.<\/p>\n<p>In Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, <i>supra,<\/i> 394 U.S. 147, at 162, 89 S.Ct. 935, at 944, Justice Harlan makes reference to \"the principle established in Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 58-61, 85 S.Ct. 734, 738-741, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965), which prohibits the States from requiring persons to invoke unduly cumbersome and time-consuming procedures before they may exercise their constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1128<\/span> right of expression.\"<sup>[15]<\/sup> See also: Teitel Film Corporation v. Cusack, 390 U.S. 139, 88 S.Ct. 754, 19 L.Ed.2d 966 (1968).<\/p>\n<p>It is to be observed that no \"specified brief period\", Freedman v. Maryland, <i>supra,<\/i> 380 U.S., at 59, 85 S.Ct. 734, within which the City Manager must make the investigation and determination of whether the granting of a permit \"will unduly disturb the convenience of the public in the use of the streets\" is prescribed by the amended ordinance. In the event of an adverse decision by the City Manager, a right of appeal to the City Commission is given to the applicant; but, again, no specified brief period for action by the City Commission on the appeal is required. The only particularization is that \"the City Secretary . . . place such appeal on the agenda of the next regular or special meeting of the Commission, and the same shall be promptly heard by the Commission.\"<sup>[16]<\/sup> This somewhat vague language does not appear to comport with the specificity demanded by <i>Freedman<\/i> and <i>Cusack.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>It should also be noted that the amended ordinance \"makes no provision for prompt, Commission-initiated judicial review.\" LeFlore v. Robinson, 434 F.2d 933, 948 (5 Cir. 1970).<sup>[17]<\/sup><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1129<\/span> \"A majority of the Supreme Court has yet to delineate explicitly the relevance of <i>Freedman<\/i> to the permit-granting process . . .\", LeFlore v. Robinson, <i>supra,<\/i> 434 F.2d, at 947; but enough has been said by the Supreme Court to foretoken that <i>Freedman<\/i> is likely to be the rule of decision in such cases. Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, <i>supra,<\/i> 394 U.S., at 155, fn. 4, 89 S.Ct. 935. Consequently, the substantiality of the defendants' claim that the adoption of the amended ordinance moots this action seems to be, at best, disputable.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to their allegations that this suit is moot, defendants claim, alternatively, that plaintiffs lack standing to bring it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"If the court finds that the representative [in a class action] actually has been harmed or affected by the challenged conduct or regulation, then he has standing. On the other hand, if the court determines that he is a mere volunteer, and is not personally aggrieved, he will not be allowed to maintain the suit. * * * The standing requirement has not been rigidly applied, however, so if plaintiff can show that there is some possibility he may be affected in the future, the court will hold generally, that he may bring the action.\" Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil Sec. 1776.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Considering the findings of this court, it is entirely apparent that McGuire and the members of the class he represents have been harmed and affected by the ordinance. The standing of the named plaintiff, McGuire, and the remaining members of the class to bring the suit is, therefore, confirmed. Reed v. Giarrusso, <i>supra<\/i>; Bailey v. Patterson, 323 F.2d 201 (5 Cir. 1963); Smith v. Y.M. C.A., 316 F.Supp. 899, 903 (M.D.Ala. 1970); Washington v.

In relevant part, the statute states:\n<\/p>\n<p>\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person:<\/p>\n<p>*   *   *   *   *<\/p>\n<p>\"(3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for the equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States . . ..\"<\/p>\n<p>[2]  The civil action was authorized by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The statute provides:\n<\/p>\n<p>\"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"<\/p>\n<p>[3]  The remainder of the findings of fact in this paragraph were made from uncontradicted testimony in Civil Action No. 5524, entitled Weaver v. Muckleroy, pending in the Tyler Division of the Eastern District of Texas. This court is entitled to take judicial notice of this evidence, Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 157, 89 S.Ct. 935, 22 L.Ed. 2d 162 (1968), since all of the present City Commissioners of Nacogdoches and the City Secretary were made parties defendant. The plaintiffs, black and white students at SFA, brought suit, <i>inter alia,<\/i> for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the City Commissioners, in selecting a date on which to submit to the voters an amendment to the City Charter of Nacogdoches that would drastically alter the manner of electing City Commissioners, could not choose a date during the three months summer vacation with the express purpose of significantly minimizing the number of voters of a particular class, <i>i. e.,<\/i> students and professors at SFA, that would vote on the amendment. The evidence showed that students and blacks had almost succeeded in electing two of their number to the City Commission at the last preceding election for municipal officers on April 4, 1972. This court granted a preliminary injunction against the holding of the election, principally relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972). The injunction was stayed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which cited Hamer v. Campbell, 358 F.2d 215 (5 Cir. 1966), cert. den. 385 U.S. 851, 87 S.Ct. 76, 17 L.Ed.2d 79, and Sargent v. Genesco, Inc., 458 F.2d 9 (5 Cir. 1972). The stay read, in part: \"The City of Nacogdoches acknowledges by applying for this stay that the election may ultimately be set aside if the District Court's judgment on the merits is affirmed. * * * The plaintiffs having attacked the election in advance, the orderly way to preserve the status quo is to allow the election to proceed with all parties aware that it may turn out to be a nullity.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>At the subsequent election, the amendment carried overwhelmingly. The City of Nacogdoches has filed notice of appeal from the order granting the preliminary injunction.<\/p>\n<p>[4]  After he announced for office, a cross was burned in his yard.<\/p>\n<p>[5]  McGuire wrongly suspected Crawford of being a surveillant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In one of his several impassioned speeches to black and white audiences in black churches in Nacogdoches, McGuire, observing the presence of Crawford, made extremely uncomplimentary and vile references to the F.B.I. When one of McGuire's speeches was reported to Roebuck by Crawford, Roebuck stated that he \"could put an end to the nigger situation by putting a 30-30 bullet between [McGuire's] eyes.\"<\/p>\n<p>[6]  She afterwards plead guilty to the offenses in the District Court of Nacogdoches County.<\/p>\n<p>[7]  Upon being told by Roebuck at the police station that Miss Dorsey's arrest was \"none of his business\", McGuire angrily declared: \"I'll burn this damn town down around your neck.\" Roebuck obviously regarded the threat with some seriousness, but he took no action on it. However, the threat was made the basis of a criminal complaint filed against McGuire in the County Court of Nacogdoches County on May 14, 1970.<\/p>\n<p>[8]  The placards and signs read as follows:\n<\/p>\n<p>\"End discrimination\"; \"Respect the black\"; \"Don't rob the poor\"; \"Together we stand, divided we fall\"; \"Blacks want equal rights\"; \"Let's live together\"; and \"Hunger is a felony\".<\/p>\n<p>[9]  Orton Hill had very few sidewalks, and the streets were largely unpaved.<\/p>\n<p>[10]  The charges against McGuire were: (1) knowingly and wilfully committing an act, that is, \"leading and urging on a mob by gestures and loud shouting, which under the circumstances was reasonably calculated to and did produce a clear and present and immediate threat to the property of another\"; (2) \"disorderly conduct, to-wit, by engaging in behavior of a boisterous and tumultuous character, to-wit, by shouting, screaming and yelling in a public place . . . in such a manner as to create a clear and present danger of alarming persons where no legitimate reason for alarm exists\"; (3) \"by threatening words, to-wit: `I'll burn this damn town down around your neck', [McGuire] attempted to prevent M.

Roebuck, Chief of Police of the City of Nacogdoches, Texas, from performing the duties of his lawful employment as Chief of Police . . .\"; (4) \"disorderly conduct, to-wit, by engaging in behavior near and in the Nacogdoches County Courthouse wherein judicial proceedings were being had, to-wit, the felony arraignment of the subject Cubie Nell Dorsey, which behavior was designed and had the effect of interfering with the administration of justice, and which behavior consisted of the agitation of a group of persons by shouting loudly and threatening to free the said Cubie Nell Dorsey, which behavior had the effect of disrupting the Justice Court of Precinct No. 1, Nacogdoches County, Texas\"; and (5) \"disorderly conduct, to-wit, by then and there engaging in violent and forceful behavior, to-wit, by shouting, screaming and gesturing, in a public place, to-wit, in the right-of-way of East Main Street in the City of Nacogdoches, Texas, there being a clear and present danger therefrom that free movement of other persons, to-wit, members of the public, would be arrested or restrained in the lawful exercise of business and amusement by the blockage of said East Main Street consequent to said behavior.\" All of the complaints except (3) were signed by Smith Parmer and related to the events of May 13, 1970, other than (4) which made reference to April 24, 1970. The complaint in (3) was signed by Roebuck and referred to the date of April 24, 1970.<\/p>\n<p>[11]  \"No procession, excepting the forces of the United States Army or Navy, the military forces of this State, and the forces of the Police and Fire Department, shall occupy, march or proceed along any street except in accordance with a permit issued by the City Manager.

The above does not apply to funeral processions.\"<\/p>\n<p>[12]  Several of the decisions relating to ordinances requiring permits are collated in Staub v.

The plaintiff, Mickey Washington McGuire, a 33 year old black citizen, filed suit under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1113\"> \n   *1113\n   <\/span>\n  1343(3)\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">\n   1\n  <\/a>\n  and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">\n   2\n  <\/a>\n  against the defendants, the City of Nacogdoches and its Chief of Police, the Honorable M. C. Roebuck, on August 3, 1970. The suit sought,\n  <em>\n   inter alia,\n  <\/em>\n  a declaratory judgment that the parade ordinance relied upon by the police as justification for their action in breaking up the band of civil rights partisans is unconstitutional, an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance by the defendants, and the maintenance of the action as a class action. On motion of McGuire\u2019s counsel, the case was continued on three separate occasions, and eventually came to trial on April 10,1972.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1173-14\">\n  In 1970 Nacogdoches was a city of about 22,500 population. The Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA), which lies within the municipal boundaries, had a student population of about 10,000. Racial bias and discriminatory practices associated with a segregated society are but slowly being eradicated in Nacogdoches. The black community in Nacogdoches, consisting of approximately 5,500 persons, is situated in a well-defined area called Orton Hill. Motion picture theaters were still segregated as late as 1969. The dual school system was not dismantled until 1970.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">\n   3\n  <\/a>\n  The county jail, which is situated in Na\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1114\"> \n   *1114\n   <\/span>\n  cogdoches, is still segregated. No black citizen has been elected in either municipal or county office in Nacogdoches County in modern times. One black unsuccessfully ran for the office of County Commissioner in 1959.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">\n   4\n  <\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">\n  McGuire, born and reared in Mobile, Alabama, was convicted of several felonies, involving burglary and larceny, when he was about 17 years of age. While incarcerated in the Alabama state prison system pursuant to his convictions, he managed to educate himself to some extent. In 1966, after having served six years\u2019 confinement, he obtained his release from prison by virtue of the writ of coram nobis, issued by an Alabama court. McGuire has no record of convictions since his release from prison.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">\n  In April 1970, although he was not a student, McGuire was an organizer for the National Black Student Association. In the course of his organizational activities in Houston, Texas, McGuire met several black students from SFA, who invited him to organize a chapter of the National Black Students Association at SFA. McGuire accepted the invitation, and met with a warm reception at SFA among certain elements of the students and faculty. He discussed the rights and problems of blacks in several classes conducted by white professors, and also spoke to a number of groups in the black community.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">\n  McGuire\u2019s arrival in Nacogdoches was duly reported to Chief Roebuck, who viewed the role of black militants and student activists in creating tumult and discord on the campuses and in the cities throughout the nation with extreme apprehension. Roebuck assigned a self-described \u201cconservative\u201d white SFA student named Russell Crawford (who volunteered to serve in an undercover capacity) to observe the movements and activities of McGuire.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">\n   5\n  <\/a>\n  Roebuck also requested information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning McGuire, and was subsequently furnished by it with a copy of McGuire\u2019s \u201crap sheet\u201d.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">\n  On April 24, 1970, a black female student, Cubie Nell Dorsey, was arrested by city policemen on the campus of SFA and charged with the offenses of forgery and passing of a check at a Nacogdoches store.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">\n   6\n  <\/a>\n  Although he was not acquainted with Miss Dorsey, McGuire proceeded to intervene with the police, in an effort to see that her rights were protected. ' Immediately following' her arrest, McGuire engaged in abrasive conversations concerning Miss Dorsey with the arresting officers on the campus at SFA, and later with Roebuck at the police station.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">\n   7\n  <\/a>\n  Finally, he attempted to be present, as an observer, at her initial appearance before a magistrate, where she was to be informed of her legal rights.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1174-13\">\n  The hearing before the magistrate, the Honorable Carl Burrows, then Justice of the Peace, was conducted in a small courtroom in the Nacogdoches County Courthouse. McGuire and several of his followers appeared at the hall\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1115\"> \n   *1115\n   <\/span>\n  way entrance to the courtroom, and McGuire knocked loudly on the closed courtroom door. Upon instructions from the Justice of the Peace, Roebuck directed McGuire and those who accompanied him to leave the premises. McGuire and the others, complaining loudly, reluctantly complied with the request.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">\n  The arrest of Miss Dorsey triggered the inception of about 15 demonstrations, inspired by McGuire, in the main business section of the city. Black citizens of Nacogdoches and black and white students from SFA participated in the demonstrations. The demonstrators, who appear to have ranged in number from five to twenty at a time, carried signs and placards indicating discontent with the lot of blacks in Nacogdoches.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">\n   8\n  <\/a>\n  All of the demonstrations were conducted on the sidewalks, in the daytime, and were entirely orderly and peaceful. The police made no effort to interfere with the picketing, aside from taking still photographs and moving pictures of the participants. When the sidewalk demonstrations began, Chief Roebuck, manifestly alarmed by them, requested the Department of Public Safety to furnish additional personnel to the Nacogdoches area for emergency use. Thirty extra patrolmen were assigned by the Department of Public Safety to Nacogdoches on April 25, 1970, and thereafter on a daily basis through May 13, 1970.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">\n  On May 4, 1970, several students were killed by National Guard troops at Kent State University in Ohio, which precipitated demonstrations by students on the campuses of colleges and universities all over the United States. A few days before May 13, 1970, in memorium to the dead students at Kent State, white and black students of SFA conducted a large so-called \u201ccandlelight march\u201d between the campus and the main business quarter of Nacogdoches. This march was made entirely on the sidewalks bordering North-South Street (State Highway No. 59), the main-traveled street in Nacogdoches. The Kent State incident and the related demonstrations, local and nationwide, reenforced Chief Roebuck\u2019s fears of widespread revolutionary activities in the United States.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">\n  On May 11, 1970, two black SFA students planned another candlelight march for the night of May 13, 1970, to demonstrate \u201ca spirit of brotherhood between black and white citizens of Nacogdoches.\u201d On the night of May 13, a group of black and white students met in the home of Helena Patton, a black student, in the Orton Hill area of Nacogdoches. McGuire, who had been out of the city, arrived at the Patton home immediately before the beginning of the march. The leadership of the procession intended that it should proceed from the Patton home to the Federal Building, located in the main business portion of Nacogdoches, and then return to the point of origin. The procession was planned and executed as a columnar formation, complete with parade marshals to keep the column in order. At the inception of the demonstration, the participants marched, five abreast, through the streets of the Orton Hill district.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">\n   9\n  <\/a>\n  As it wound its way through the Orton Hill area, numerous other blacks joined the procession until it numbered about 250.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">\n  The column of demonstrators left the Orton Hill area by way of Shawnee Street, proceeding in a northerly direction. When the column arrived at East Main Street, which leads to the main business sector of the city, it turned west. The demonstrators obeyed the traffic signals at the intersection, and no traffic was blocked. After turning west onto East Main Street, the demonstrators, still in a well-controlled column, stayed largely on the sidewalks on the north side of the street, although there was some overflow onto the part of the\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1116\"> \n   *1116\n   <\/span>\n  street marked by painted lines for the diagonal parking of vehicles. At the time, the demonstrators were singing patriotic songs and spirituals and chanting slogans identified with the nonviolent civil rights movement in the Southern states. Their mood was described as \u201chappy\u201d, and the demonstration was orderly.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">\n  Proceeding west along East Main Street, the procession crossed Lanana, Walker, Mound and Church Streets. East Main Street is four lanes in width as far as Mound Street, where it narrows to two lanes. There was no obstruction of traffic by the demonstrators as far as Mound Street; but by reason of the narrowing of the street at that point, the north lane of traffic was partially obstructed by the marchers, after they passed Mound Street. Nevertheless, the normal flow of traffic was not materially interfered with by the marchers.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">\n  When the column reached the main business portion of town, near the vicinity of Mound and Church Streets, vehicular traffic was light. It was approximately 9:00 o\u2019clock p. m., and none of the business firms were open, except for a business college on the second floor of a building overlooking East Main Street. After the demonstrators passed Church Street, but before they reached the next street, Fredonia, they were turned back by members of the Nacogdoches police force and other law enforcement officers.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">\n  The demonstrators had been observed by a black member of the police force at the intersection of Shawnee and East Main Street. This policeman drove to the police station, located one block south of East Main Street on Fredonia Street, where he notified patrolman Smith Parmer of the march. Parmer communicated with Chief Roebuck by telephone; and other law enforcement personnel were immediately notified of the demonstration by police radio dispatchers. Parmer then sped in his police vehicle to the head of the procession, where McGuire was in the lead. Although no violence or disruptions had attended the march up to this point, except for the noise made by the demonstrators in singing and chanting, Parmer peremptorily directed McGuire and the rest of the demonstrators to turn back. Parmer\u2019s commands were ignored, and he thereupon arrested, at gunpoint, McGuire and another black, one Willie Wade, who were immediately transported to the City Jail of Nacogdoches in a police vehicle. During the period while McGuire and Wade were being arrested, and after their departure, the marchers surged forward and partially blocked East Main Street.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">\n  Numerous law enforcement officers, including Chief Roebuck, Texas Department of Public Safety personnel, and members of the staff of the Sheriff of Nacogdoches County, had by this time arrived on the scene. In response to commands from the police and other law enforcement officers, and also in reaction to directions from their parade marshals, the demonstrators returned to the raised sidewalks on the north side of East Main Street and proceeded east. To hasten the marchers along their way to the sidewalks and to the east, a few of the police officers present resorted to the indiscriminate use of mace. Other force was used by the law enforcement officers, but there were no serious injuries inflicted on any of the demonstrators or the officers.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">\n  The dispositions of certain of the marchers apparently turned ugly as they proceeded toward Shawnee Street, and two trash cans were overturned. When they reached the intersection of East Main Street and Shawnee Street, the demonstrators congregated on a vacant lot, and a number cursed and threw rocks and bottles at the peace officers confronting them. The plate glass windows of two business establishments were broken, as well as several automobile windshields, and a wooden boat next to a store was set on fire; but the identity of the demonstrators involved in the various acts of vandalism was not established.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">\n<span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1117\"> \n   *1117\n   <\/span>\n  The demonstrators were then driven back onto Shawnee Street and into the Orton Hill vicinity by peace officers, where they reassembled at the home of Helena Patton, the point from which the march had originated. A new leader, Rufus Woodrow, a black athlete at SFA, rallied the dispirited demonstrators, and they again attempted to march from the Orton Hill area into the white part of the city. A phalanx of heavily armed peace officers blocked their departure, however, at each of the several exits from the Orton Hill community. On one of these occasions, another rock throwing incident occurred. However, Woodrow managed to stop the activities of the overwrought rock throwers, and no other acts of violence accompanied the marches. Eventually, the peace officers permitted the demonstrators to disperse and return to their homes without further embroilment.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">\n  McGuire remained at the City Jail for about one hour. He was then taken to the County Jail at Nacogdoches County, two blocks away, accompanied by a large contingent of armed law enforcement officers and approximately five police vehicles. McGuire remained, incommunicado, in the County Jail until May 15, 1970, at about 8:00 a. m., when he was taken before Carl Burrows, the Justice of the Peace. Burrows set bail on five misdemeanor charges, which had been filed against McGuire in the County Court of Nacogdoches County on May 14, 1970, in the total sum of $105,000.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">\n   10\n  <\/a>\n  He had never before set bail as high as this in any misdemeanor cases.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">\n  The judge of the Corporation Court, the Honorable H. W. Whitten, was also present on this occasion. Judge Whitten informed McGuire that he was charged with the violation of -two ordinances of the City of Nacogdoches, and bail was set at $1,000.00 for each offense. One of the complaints in the Corporation Court charged McGuire with a violation of Section 21-37 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Nacogdoches. The ordinance in question, which was adopted on August 9, 1965, is set out in the margin.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">\n   11\n  <\/a>\n  After the hearings before the\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1118\"> \n   *1118\n   <\/span>\n  Justice of the Peace and the City Judge, McGuire was returned to the Nacogdoches County Jail, where he remained for about one week. The Honorable George Middlebrook, at that time the County Judge of Nacogdoches County, then revoked the orders of the Justice of the Peace setting bail for McGuire, and lowered the bail to a total of $7,500. McGuire subsequently made bail for both the state and city offenses charged against him.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">\n  McGuire left the City of Nacogdoches some months after his arrest. He had not been brought to trial for any of the offenses charged against him in either the County Court of Nacogdoches County or the Municipal Court of the City of Nacogdoches at the time of the trial of the instant case. A few sidewalk demonstrations by blacks occurred in Nacogdoches in the days following the arrest of McGuire on May 13, 1970; but no street processions or sidewalk demonstrations of any type have taken place since that time.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">\n  Since McGuire is seeking a declaratory judgment that the procession ordinance which he is charged with violating in the Corporation Court of the City of Nacogdoches is unconstitutional, the Court is confronted with the decision of the Supreme Court in Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L. Ed.2d 688 (1971). It was there held that where a state prosecution is pending, \u201cthe same equitable principles relevant to the propriety of an injunction must be taken into consideration by federal district courts in determining whether to issue a declaratory judgment.\u201d Thus, if an injunction would be impermissible under the circumstances, \u201cdeclaratory relief should ordinarily be denied as well.\u201d\n  <em>\n   Id.,\n  <\/em>\n  at 73, 91 S.Ct. at 768.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">\n  Until the Supreme Court decided Mitchum v. Foster, 1972, 407 U.S. 225, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705, one posited obstacle to injunctive relief in suits brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, was the federal anti-injunction act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283, which provides that a federal court may not enjoin state court proceedings \u201cexcept as authorized by Act of Congress.\u201d In\n  <em>\n   Mitchum,\n  <\/em>\n  it was decided that \u00a7 1983 is within that exception; but the court was at pains to emphasize that it did not \u201c. . . question or qualify in any way the principles of equity, comity, and federalism that must restrain a federal court when asked to enjoin a state court proceeding.\u201d\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  <\/em>\n  at 243, 92 S.Ct. at 2163.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">\n  These principles were dealt with at length in Younger v.

[746.] at 751. It made clear that even \u2018the possible unconstitutionality of a statute \u201con its face\u201d does not in itself justify an injunction against good faith attempts to enforce it.\u2019 401 U.S., at 54, 91 S. Ct. [746] at 755. At the same time, however, the Court clearly left room for federal injunctive intervention in a pending state court prosecution in certain exceptional circumstances\u2014 where irreparable injury is both \u2018great and immediate,\u2019 401 U.S., at 46, 91 S.Ct. [746,] at 751, where the state law is \u2018flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions,\u2019 401 U.S., at 53, 91 S.Ct. [746,] at 755, or where there is a showing of \u2018bad faith, harassment, or other unusual circumstances that would call for equitable relief.\u2019 401 U.S., at 54, 91 S.Ct. [746] at 755,\u201d Mitchum v. Foster,\n  <em>\n   supra,\n  <\/em>\n  407 U.S., at 230, 92 S.Ct., at 2156.\n <\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-3\">\n<span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1119\"> \n   *1119\n   <\/span>\n  The defendants rely upon the ordinance adopted on August 9, 1965 (relating to processions upon the streets of Nacogdoches), as a justification for the actions of the police in forcibly disbanding the demonstrators. It is undisputed that the demonstrators did not apply for a permit to conduct a procession, as required by the ordinance. The first question, then, is whether it is \u201cflagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions.\u201d\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\">\n  \u201cThe right to use a public place for expressive activity may be restricted only for weighty reasons,\u201d Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2303, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972), and any system of prior restraints of expression comes to a federal court \u201cbearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.\u201d Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70, 83 S.Ct. 631, 639, 9 L.Ed.2d 584. In particular, expressive activity relating to the use of the streets of a municipality is entitled to First Amendment protection, for\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-5\">\n  \u201c[w]herever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for the purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens.\u201d Hague v. C. I. O., 307 U.S. 496, 515-516, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423.\n <\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">\n  The City obviously failed to overcome the presumption against the constitutionality of the ordinance of August 9, 1965. The ordinance conferred upon the City Manager exclusive and unrestrained authority to grant or deny permits to conduct parades and processions on the streets of Nacogdoches and did not, even colorably, purport to impose any standards to guide the City Manager in his decision-making process. Numerous decisions of the Supreme Court and lower courts have invalidated ordinances which give authority to a public official to sanction or prohibit, at will, the exercise of expressive activity. Thus, in Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 150-151, 89 S.Ct. 935, 939, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969), it was held:\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-9\">\n  \u201c[A] law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional. \u2018It is settled . that an ordinance which, like this one, makes the peaceful enjoyment of freedoms which the Constitution guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled will of an official \u2014 as by requiring a permit or license which may be granted or withheld in the discretion of such official \u2014 is an unconstitutional censorship or prior restraint upon the enjoyment of those freedoms.\u2019 Staub v. Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 322, 78 S.Ct. 277, 282, 2 L.Ed.2d 302.\u201d\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">\n   12\n  <\/a>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">\n  Defendants point to the fact that the City Manager had granted 65 permits and had never refused to issue a permit for a procession, up to and including May 13, 1970. The defendants contend that \u201c[t]he only requirement was that the paraders (demonstrators) should check with the police department to arrange the route and for police supervision in order to insure the proper flow of traffic and proper observation of the law.\u201d They apparently suggest, therefore, that a construction was placed on the ordinance by the City which is binding upon this court. This contention ignores the holdings of the Fifth Circuit in Anderson v. Nosser, 438 F.2d 183, 194 (5 Cir. 1971), Strother v. Thompson, 372 F.2d 654 (5 Cir. 1967), and Guyot v.

Almost half of those granted were for Negroes and\/or civil rights demonstrations.\u201d\n <\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">\n  In Strother v. Thompson, supra, 372 F.2d, at 657, the court held :\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-12\">\n  \u201cWe can find nothing in the ordinance which requires the Council to issue a license. The ordinance carries no command to grant an application, neither does it prescribe the criteria or standards upon which an application is to be denied. * * * [W]hen the ordinance is altogether silent as to when and under what circumstances the permit shall or shall not be granted, then there is no way to find out what would constitute legal discretion. Only unfettered power remains.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-14\">\n  \u201cWe are, therefore, of the opinion that this ordinance is indeed unconstitutional on its face and cannot be squared with constitutional guarantees.\u201d\n <\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-15\">\n  This court has not been directed to any decision by the state courts which has construed the ordinance and \u201cdefined the limitations of the authority conferred for the granting of licenses for parade and processions\u201d, as was the case in Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 575, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941). It is not within the power of this court to thus narrow the ordinance. United States v. 37 Photographs, 402 U. S. 363, 369, 91 S.Ct. 1400, 28 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971). Hence, because of its failure to set any standards whatsoever to guide the licensing authority, the ordinance is patently and flagrantly unconstitutional on its face.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1180-16\">\n  The defendants maintain that since the plaintiffs made no effort to comply with the provisions of the ordinance which required a permit for a procession, they are not entitled to complain of its unconstitutionality. But this contention had been foreclosed by Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, supra, 394 U.S., at 151, 89 S.Ct., at 939, and the cases cited there, where it was declared that:\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-17\">\n  \u201c[0]ur decisions have made clear that a person faced with such an unconstitutional licensing law may ignore it and engage with impunity in the exercise of the right of free expression for which the law purports to require a license.\u201d\n <\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-18\">\n  Considering the invalidity of the ordinance of August 9, 1965, it is thus clear that McGuire and other black and white dissidents in Nacogdoches were entitled to the free expression of their ideas on\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1121\"> \n   *1121\n   <\/span>\n  the streets of Nacogdoches, even though their views were regarded with hostility and apprehension by the Chief of Police and other officials. As said in Robinson v. Coopwood, 292 F.Supp. 926, 934 (N. D.Miss.1968), aff\u2019d 415 F.2d 1377 (5 Cir. 1969):\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-5\">\n  \u201cThe exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly cannot be made a crime, nor may those who seek to freely exercise those rights be criminally punished for failure to previously register their intentions with law enforcement officers, in absence of a situation involving clear and present violence, or threat thereof.\u201d\n <\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">\n  The record in this case abundantly demonstrates that, until it was broken up by law officers, no such clear and present danger of violence or disruption existed in connection with the march in issue. It was conducted at a time when automotive traffic was light in the main business section of town, and the marchers were orderly and well behaved until routed by law officers. Certainly the minor inconvenience to traffic occasioned by the march could not validly be equated with a \u201cserious substantive evil.\u201d Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131. The extensive picketing activities in the business area of Nacogdoches had failed to produce any disturbances which would qualify as threats to the public order or safety; and the first candlelight march likewise did not result in rioting or other unlawful activities by the participants. In view of these circumstances, the police and other officers of the law were not legally warranted in preventing the march on the basis of threatened public disorders, for \u201cundifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression.\u201d Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503, at 508, 89 S.Ct. 733, at 737, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969).\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">\n  An arguable case may be made that the original ordinance of August 9, 1965, is invalid, also, because of its discriminatory enforcement by the police,\n  <em>\n   i. e.,\n  <\/em>\n  demonstrations by college students in celebration of victories by the SFA basketball team were not disturbed by the police, even though no demonstration permits were applied for or granted. Cox v. Louisiana,\n  <em>\n   supra,\n  <\/em>\n  379 U.S., at 557, 85 S.Ct. 453. But see Robinson v. Coopwood,\n  <em>\n   supra,\n  <\/em>\n  292 F.Supp., at 934. It may also be contended that both the original ordinance and the amended ordinance, hereafter referred to, are unconstitutional, because they make distinctions between peaceful funeral processions and military marches, on the one hand, and other peaceful demonstrations, on the other hand. Police Department of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972); Grayned v. City of Rockford,\n  <em>\n   supra.\n  <\/em>\n  However, a decision on these postulated grounds for invalidity of the ordinances is not necessary, and they will not be considered further.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">\n  There remains for consideration whether the existing prosecution of McGuire for a violation of the original procession ordinance is in bad faith and without hope of obtaining a valid conviction. Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82, 85, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). The attorneys for defendants, demonstrating a remarkable lack of candor with the court, have refused to acknowledge the unqonstitutionality of the challenged ordinance; but the members of the City Commission have tacitly done so,\n  <em>\n   %. e.,\n  <\/em>\n  by making reference to the \u201cpossibility of the unconstitutionality\u201d of the original ordinance in the recitations preceding their passage of the amended ordinance. However, there are other considerations affecting this court\u2019s conclusion of the existence of bad faith prosecution which are of more weight.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">\n  The following colloquy between the court and the Honorable S. M. Adams, City Attorney of Nacogdoches, is quoted from the record:\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-12\">\n  THE COURT: * * * Perhaps the City Attorney, who is present here in court, may tell me what the disposition of the city is toward any prosecu\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1122\"> \n   *1122\n   <\/span>\n  tion that might be contemplated against the Plaintiff at this time.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-4\">\n  MR.

ADAMS: Yes, sir.\n <\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">\n  A reference to the testimony of the District Attorney and the County Attorney, taken by deposition at the request of the Court, is revealing. The District Attorney, the Honorable David Adams, testified that he had no role, function, responsibility, or duties in the County Court of Nacogdoches County; that he prosecuted only in the District Courts; and that he had not presented to any grand jury any case of felony grade against McGuire for indictment, and knew of none to present.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">\n  The following are extracts from the testimony of the Honorable Bryan Davis, County Attorney of Nacogdoches County:\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">\n  [Questions by Mr. Watts, attorney for the plaintiff:]\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-10\">\n  Q.

He has been in approximately two years. Two years this January.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-31\">\n  Q. Did he become County Judge of Nacogdoches County, pursuant to a run-off election held in June of 1970?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-32\">\n  A. He did.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-33\">\n  Q. And it is his sole responsibility to select the cases that will be placed upon the trial docket and to call those cases for trial in Nacogdoches County Court?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-34\">\n  A. Yes.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-35\">\n  Q. Do you know what the intentions are of the Court, at this time, for calling the five complaints lodged against Mr. McGuire, in that Court are, regarding trial or disposition of those causes ?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-36\">\n  A. No, sir. I do not, so far as being able to speak for the Court. What the Court\u2019s intentions are in the matter, I couldn\u2019t say.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-37\">\n  Q. What are your intentions regarding those complaints?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-38\">\n  A. My intentions at the present time are to treat them as I treat most of our other eases which are active pending cases on the docket. That is simply to, if asked by the Judge what my opinion is about\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1123\"> \n   *1123\n   <\/span>\n  setting them, I would give him my opinion.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-4\">\n  Q.

I would like to ask you this, since you testified a moment ago when Mr. Potter asked you the question regarding whether or not a fair and impartial trial could have occurred, immediately succeeding the filing of these complaints against Mr. McGuire, in the County Court and you said it was your opinion because of the air of emotionalism that prevailed at that time \u2014 let me ask you this, do you think that that same attitude of emotionalism prevails at this date?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-12\">\n  A. Since Mr. McGuire has removed himself from our midst, I don\u2019t feel that we have such tension as we had then. I think that we have a good deal left.

No.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-20\">\n  Q. Have they ever been placed on any docket, any criminal docket in County Court?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-21\">\n  A. You mean before I went in there ?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-22\">\n  Q. Since you have taken office ?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-23\">\n  A. No.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-24\">\n  Q. Now, who in the County Court\u2019s office, either the clerk\u2019s or your office as County Judge, designates which criminal cases will be set for trial during the sessions per year?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-25\">\n  A. Me and the County Attorney.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-26\">\n  Q. The County Attorney participates in that with you.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-27\">\n  A. Yes.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-28\">\n  Q. Does he actually take the lead or do you take the lead ?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-29\">\n  A.

Have you had occasion to consult with him about setting any of these five cases charged against Mr. McGuire for trial ?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-33\">\n  A. No. Let me tell you something. When I went in office in 1971, there was a large backlog of cases on the docket. There hadn\u2019t been over a dozen cases tried in County Court in the last eight years.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-34\">\n  Q. Are you saying that these cases pending against Mr. McGuire have not been set for trial because of the backlog ?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-35\">\n  A. We haven\u2019t caught up to them.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-36\">\n  Q. When do you expect to catch up to them?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-37\">\n  A.

And you say you would like to try them this year?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-15\">\n  A. Yes.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-16\">\n  Q.

If he is not agreeable and wouldn\u2019t, how could I ?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-20\">\n  Q. Well, you can either try cases or you can dismiss them. You can dispose of the case, you see. Are you going to set the cases down and try them?\n <\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1184-21\">\n  MR. WATTS: Let the witness say what he\u2019s going to do.\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-22\">\n  A. Yes, I will set them down.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-23\">\n  Q. I mean do you intend to set the cases down this year ?\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-24\">\n  A. Yes.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-25\">\n  Q. Now, when they are set down, at that time if the County Attorney is not ready, and I\u2019m not asking you to pre-judge them or to say now what you are going to do at that time, but if you do set them down this year, will you decide at that time whether you are going to put the County Attorney to trial whether he wants to try them, or not. Otherwise, I want you to have this advise: That it is for the Judge to decide what he is going to do with the case when he sets it for trial and not the County Attorney.\n <\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-26\">\n  A. Well, knowing the County Attorney like I do and the respect I have for him, I think he would respect my wishes enough to try the cases.\n <\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1184-27\">\n  It is implicit from the statement of the County Attorney and the foregoing testimony that the City Attorney and the County Attorney entered into an agreement, tacit or otherwise, that so long as McGuire absented himself from Nacogdoches, neither would make any effort to bring him to trial, and this court so finds. Assuming McGuire\u2019s continued nonpresence in Nacogdoches, it is doubtful that the County Court prosecutions directed against him would ever have occurred, taking into account the fact that the lay County Judge was not cognizant of his power to set and to try cases without the concurrence of the County Attorney. Hence, it is this court\u2019s opinion that the bona fides of the prosecutions against McGuire in the County Court is subject to question.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1184-28\">\n  But regardless of the status of the prosecutions in County Court, the question before the court at this juncture is whether the prosecution in Corporation Court is being conducted in good faith. The City Attorney advanced no explanation or rationalization for his determination that he would abide by the decision of the County Attorney and the District Attorney respecting McGuire\u2019s continued prosecution in the Corporation Court, nor is this court able\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1125\"> \n   *1125\n   <\/span>\n  to perceive any valid reason or justification for his decision. On the contrary, this court finds that the City Attorney is fully aware of the constitutional invalidity of the original procession ordinance, and that the purpose and effect of his failure to move for the dismissal of the charge against McGuire was and is to intimidate, threaten and coerce other blacks from exercising their constitutional rights to free speech and assembly. Duncan v. Perez, 321 F.Supp. 181, 184-185 (E.D.La.1970), aff\u2019d 445 F.2d 557 (5 Cir. 1971); United States v. McLeod, 385 F.2d 734, 744-745 (5 Cir. 1967).\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">\n  Considering the glaring and evident unconstitutionality of the ordinance of August 9, 1965, and the bad faith prosecution of McGuire in the Corporation Court, the prerequisites of Samuels v. Mackell,\n  <em>\n   supra,\n  <\/em>\n  have been met, and a declaration of the invalidity of the ordinance is proper. There is still left for resolution, however, the other contentions of the defendants.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">\n  Defendants argue that this action has been mooted, because: (1) McGuire no longer resides in Nacogdoches; (2) McGuire is not now an organizer for the National Black Students Association; (3) Nacogdoches is now quiet and orderly, there having been no demonstrations on its streets or sidewalks since McGuire left the city; and (4) a new ordinance relating to processions was adopted by the City Commission of the City of Nacogdoches on September 22, 1971.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">\n  The finding of a bad faith prosecution establishes irreparable injury to McGuire, both great and immediate, for purposes of the comity restraints discussed in\n  <em>\n   Younger.\n  <\/em>\n  Shaw v. Garrison, 467 F.2d 113 (5 Cir. 1972). This harm to McGuire remains impendent and unsoftened, regardless of his present residence or occupation, and without respect to the present state of public order in Nacogdoches. It is thus unrealistic to assert that the controversy is moot as to McGuire.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">\n  Furthermore, with reference to the third argument, it should be noted that this action is maintainable as a class action, the members of the class being those persons in Nacogdoches who desire to demonstrate lawfully on the streets of that city in behalf of civil rights\" for blacks. Jenkins v. United Gas Corp., 400 F.2d 28, 34 (5 Cir. 1968). See also: Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to Subdivision (b)(2), of 23 F.R.Civ.P., and cases there cited.\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-9\">\n  \u201c[T]he class suit is a uniquely appropriate procedure in civil rights cases, which generally involve an allegation of discrimination against a group as well as the violation of rights of particular individuals.

City of Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 157, 89 S.Ct. 935, 22 L.Ed. 2d 162 (1968), since all of the present City Commissioners of Nacogdoches and the City Secretary were made parties defendant. The plaintiffs, black and white students at SFA, brought suit,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   <\/em>\n   for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the City Commissioners, in selecting a date on which to submit to the voters an amendment to the City Charter of Nacogdoches that would drastically alter the manner of electing City Commissioners, could not choose a date during the three months summer vacation with the express purpose of significantly minimizing the number of voters of a particular class,\n   <em>\n    i. e.,\n   <\/em>\n   students and professors at SFA, that would vote on the amendment. The evidence showed that students and blacks had almost succeeded in electing two of their number to the City Commission at the last preceding election for municipal officers on April 4, 1972. This court granted a preliminary injunction against the holding of the election, principally relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972). The injunction was stayed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which cited Hamer v.

The stay read, in part : \u201cThe City of Nacogdoches acknowledges by applying for this stay that the election may ultimately be set aside if the District Court\u2019s judgment on the merits is affirmed. * * * The plaintiffs having attacked the election in advance, the orderly way to preserve the status quo is to allow the election to proceed with all parties aware that it may turn out to be a nullity.\u201d\n  <\/p>\n<p id=\"AqXW\">\n   At the subsequent election, the amendment carried overwhelmingly.

Potter, Tyler, Tex., for defendants.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER<\/h2>\n<p>JUSTICE, District Judge.<\/p>\n<p>This civil action is the outgrowth of the dispersal by the police and other law enforcement officers of a street demonstration urging support of civil rights for black citizens of Nacogdoches, Texas, on the night of May 13, 1970. The plaintiff, Mickey Washington McGuire, a 33 year old black citizen, filed suit under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1113<\/span> 1343(3)<sup>[1]<\/sup> and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<sup>[2]<\/sup> against the defendants, the City of Nacogdoches and its Chief of Police, the Honorable M. C. Roebuck, on August 3, 1970. The suit sought, <i>inter alia,<\/i> a declaratory judgment that the parade ordinance relied upon by the police as justification for their action in breaking up the band of civil rights partisans is unconstitutional, an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance by the defendants, and the maintenance of the action as a class action. On motion of McGuire's counsel, the case was continued on three separate occasions, and eventually came to trial on April 10, 1972.<\/p>\n<p>In 1970 Nacogdoches was a city of about 22,500 population. The Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA), which lies within the municipal boundaries, had a student population of about 10,000. Racial bias and discriminatory practices associated with a segregated society are but slowly being eradicated in Nacogdoches. The black community in Nacogdoches, consisting of approximately 5,500 persons, is situated in a well-defined area called Orton Hill. Motion picture theaters were still segregated as late as 1969. The dual school system was not dismantled until 1970.<sup>[3]<\/sup> The county jail, which is situated in Nacogdoches, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1114<\/span> is still segregated. No black citizen has been elected in either municipal or county office in Nacogdoches County in modern times. One black unsuccessfully ran for the office of County Commissioner in 1959.<sup>[4]<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>McGuire, born and reared in Mobile, Alabama, was convicted of several felonies, involving burglary and larceny, when he was about 17 years of age. While incarcerated in the Alabama state prison system pursuant to his convictions, he managed to educate himself to some extent. In 1966, after having served six years' confinement, he obtained his release from prison by virtue of the writ of coram nobis, issued by an Alabama court. McGuire has no record of convictions since his release from prison.<\/p>\n<p>In April 1970, although he was not a student, McGuire was an organizer for the National Black Student Association. In the course of his organizational activities in Houston, Texas, McGuire met several black students from SFA, who invited him to organize a chapter of the National Black Students Association at SFA. McGuire accepted the invitation, and met with a warm reception at SFA among certain elements of the students and faculty. He discussed the rights and problems of blacks in several classes conducted by white professors, and also spoke to a number of groups in the black community.<\/p>\n<p>McGuire's arrival in Nacogdoches was duly reported to Chief Roebuck, who viewed the role of black militants and student activists in creating tumult and discord on the campuses and in the cities throughout the nation with extreme apprehension. Roebuck assigned a self-described \"conservative\" white SFA student named Russell Crawford (who volunteered to serve in an undercover capacity) to observe the movements and activities of McGuire.<sup>[5]<\/sup> Roebuck also requested information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning McGuire, and was subsequently furnished by it with a copy of McGuire's \"rap sheet\".<\/p>\n<p>On April 24, 1970, a black female student, Cubie Nell Dorsey, was arrested by city policemen on the campus of SFA and charged with the offenses of forgery and passing of a check at a Nacogdoches store.<sup>[6]<\/sup> Although he was not acquainted with Miss Dorsey, McGuire proceeded to intervene with the police, in an effort to see that her rights were protected. Immediately following her arrest, McGuire engaged in abrasive conversations concerning Miss Dorsey with the arresting officers on the campus at SFA, and later with Roebuck at the police station.<sup>[7]<\/sup> Finally, he attempted to be present, as an observer, at her initial appearance before a magistrate, where she was to be informed of her legal rights.<\/p>\n<p>The hearing before the magistrate, the Honorable Carl Burrows, then Justice of the Peace, was conducted in a small courtroom in the Nacogdoches County Courthouse. McGuire and several of his followers appeared at the hallway <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1115<\/span> entrance to the courtroom, and McGuire knocked loudly on the closed courtroom door. Upon instructions from the Justice of the Peace, Roebuck directed McGuire and those who accompanied him to leave the premises. McGuire and the others, complaining loudly, reluctantly complied with the request.<\/p>\n<p>The arrest of Miss Dorsey triggered the inception of about 15 demonstrations, inspired by McGuire, in the main business section of the city. Black citizens of Nacogdoches and black and white students from SFA participated in the demonstrations. The demonstrators, who appear to have ranged in number from five to twenty at a time, carried signs and placards indicating discontent with the lot of blacks in Nacogdoches.<sup>[8]<\/sup> All of the demonstrations were conducted on the sidewalks, in the daytime, and were entirely orderly and peaceful. The police made no effort to interfere with the picketing, aside from taking still photographs and moving pictures of the participants. When the sidewalk demonstrations began, Chief Roebuck, manifestly alarmed by them, requested the Department of Public Safety to furnish additional personnel to the Nacogdoches area for emergency use. Thirty extra patrolmen were assigned by the Department of Public Safety to Nacogdoches on April 25, 1970, and thereafter on a daily basis through May 13, 1970.<\/p>\n<p>On May 4, 1970, several students were killed by National Guard troops at Kent State University in Ohio, which precipitated demonstrations by students on the campuses of colleges and universities all over the United States. A few days before May 13, 1970, in memorium to the dead students at Kent State, white and black students of SFA conducted a large so-called \"candlelight march\" between the campus and the main business quarter of Nacogdoches. This march was made entirely on the sidewalks bordering North-South Street (State Highway No. 59), the main-traveled street in Nacogdoches. The Kent State incident and the related demonstrations, local and nationwide, reenforced Chief Roebuck's fears of widespread revolutionary activities in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>On May 11, 1970, two black SFA students planned another candlelight march for the night of May 13, 1970, to demonstrate \"a spirit of brotherhood between black and white citizens of Nacogdoches.\" On the night of May 13, a group of black and white students met in the home of Helena Patton, a black student, in the Orton Hill area of Nacogdoches. McGuire, who had been out of the city, arrived at the Patton home immediately before the beginning of the march. The leadership of the procession intended that it should proceed from the Patton home to the Federal Building, located in the main business portion of Nacogdoches, and then return to the point of origin. The procession was planned and executed as a columnar formation, complete with parade marshals to keep the column in order. At the inception of the demonstration, the participants marched, five abreast, through the streets of the Orton Hill district.<sup>[9]<\/sup> As it wound its way through the Orton Hill area, numerous other blacks joined the procession until it numbered about 250.<\/p>\n<p>The column of demonstrators left the Orton Hill area by way of Shawnee Street, proceeding in a northerly direction. When the column arrived at East Main Street, which leads to the main business sector of the city, it turned west. The demonstrators obeyed the traffic signals at the intersection, and no traffic was blocked. After turning west onto East Main Street, the demonstrators, still in a well-controlled column, stayed largely on the sidewalks on the north side of the street, although there was some overflow onto the part of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1116<\/span> street marked by painted lines for the diagonal parking of vehicles. At the time, the demonstrators were singing patriotic songs and spirituals and chanting slogans identified with the nonviolent civil rights movement in the Southern states. Their mood was described as \"happy\", and the demonstration was orderly.<\/p>\n<p>Proceeding west along East Main Street, the procession crossed Lanana, Walker, Mound and Church Streets. East Main Street is four lanes in width as far as Mound Street, where it narrows to two lanes. There was no obstruction of traffic by the demonstrators as far as Mound Street; but by reason of the narrowing of the street at that point, the north lane of traffic was partially obstructed by the marchers, after they passed Mound Street. Nevertheless, the normal flow of traffic was not materially interfered with by the marchers.<\/p>\n<p>When the column reached the main business portion of town, near the vicinity of Mound and Church Streets, vehicular traffic was light. It was approximately 9:00 o'clock p. m., and none of the business firms were open, except for a business college on the second floor of a building overlooking East Main Street. After the demonstrators passed Church Street, but before they reached the next street, Fredonia, they were turned back by members of the Nacogdoches police force and other law enforcement officers.<\/p>\n<p>The demonstrators had been observed by a black member of the police force at the intersection of Shawnee and East Main Street. This policeman drove to the police station, located one block south of East Main Street on Fredonia Street, where he notified patrolman Smith Parmer of the march. Parmer communicated with Chief Roebuck by telephone; and other law enforcement personnel were immediately notified of the demonstration by police radio dispatchers. Parmer then sped in his police vehicle to the head of the procession, where McGuire was in the lead. Although no violence or disruptions had attended the march up to this point, except for the noise made by the demonstrators in singing and chanting, Parmer peremptorily directed McGuire and the rest of the demonstrators to turn back. Parmer's commands were ignored, and he thereupon arrested, at gunpoint, McGuire and another black, one Willie Wade, who were immediately transported to the City Jail of Nacogdoches in a police vehicle. During the period while McGuire and Wade were being arrested, and after their departure, the marchers surged forward and partially blocked East Main Street.<\/p>\n<p>Numerous law enforcement officers, including Chief Roebuck, Texas Department of Public Safety personnel, and members of the staff of the Sheriff of Nacogdoches County, had by this time arrived on the scene. In response to commands from the police and other law enforcement officers, and also in reaction to directions from their parade marshals, the demonstrators returned to the raised sidewalks on the north side of East Main Street and proceeded east. To hasten the marchers along their way to the sidewalks and to the east, a few of the police officers present resorted to the indiscriminate use of mace. Other force was used by the law enforcement officers, but there were no serious injuries inflicted on any of the demonstrators or the officers.<\/p>\n<p>The dispositions of certain of the marchers apparently turned ugly as they proceeded toward Shawnee Street, and two trash cans were overturned. When they reached the intersection of East Main Street and Shawnee Street, the demonstrators congregated on a vacant lot, and a number cursed and threw rocks and bottles at the peace officers confronting them. The plate glass windows of two business establishments were broken, as well as several automobile windshields, and a wooden boat next to a store was set on fire; but the identity of the demonstrators involved in the various acts of vandalism was not established.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1117<\/span> The demonstrators were then driven back onto Shawnee Street and into the Orton Hill vicinity by peace officers, where they reassembled at the home of Helena Patton, the point from which the march had originated. A new leader, Rufus Woodrow, a black athlete at SFA, rallied the dispirited demonstrators, and they again attempted to march from the Orton Hill area into the white part of the city. A phalanx of heavily armed peace officers blocked their departure, however, at each of the several exits from the Orton Hill community. On one of these occasions, another rock throwing incident occurred. However, Woodrow managed to stop the activities of the overwrought rock throwers, and no other acts of violence accompanied the marches. Eventually, the peace officers permitted the demonstrators to disperse and return to their homes without further embroilment.<\/p>\n<p>McGuire remained at the City Jail for about one hour. He was then taken to the County Jail at Nacogdoches County, two blocks away, accompanied by a large contingent of armed law enforcement officers and approximately five police vehicles. McGuire remained, incommunicado, in the County Jail until May 15, 1970, at about 8:00 a. m., when he was taken before Carl Burrows, the Justice of the Peace. Burrows set bail on five misdemeanor charges, which had been filed against McGuire in the County Court of Nacogdoches County on May 14, 1970, in the total sum of $105,000.<sup>[10]<\/sup> He had never before set bail as high as this in any misdemeanor cases.<\/p>\n<p>The judge of the Corporation Court, the Honorable H. W. Whitten, was also present on this occasion. Judge Whitten informed McGuire that he was charged with the violation of two ordinances of the City of Nacogdoches, and bail was set at $1,000.00 for each offense. One of the complaints in the Corporation Court charged McGuire with a violation of Section 21-37 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Nacogdoches. The ordinance in question, which was adopted on August 9, 1965, is set out in the margin.<sup>[11]<\/sup> After the hearings before the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1118<\/span> Justice of the Peace and the City Judge, McGuire was returned to the Nacogdoches County Jail, where he remained for about one week. The Honorable George Middlebrook, at that time the County Judge of Nacogdoches County, then revoked the orders of the Justice of the Peace setting bail for McGuire, and lowered the bail to a total of $7,500. McGuire subsequently made bail for both the state and city offenses charged against him.<\/p>\n<p>McGuire left the City of Nacogdoches some months after his arrest. He had not been brought to trial for any of the offenses charged against him in either the County Court of Nacogdoches County or the Municipal Court of the City of Nacogdoches at the time of the trial of the instant case. A few sidewalk demonstrations by blacks occurred in Nacogdoches in the days following the arrest of McGuire on May 13, 1970; but no street processions or sidewalk demonstrations of any type have taken place since that time.<\/p>\n<p>Since McGuire is seeking a declaratory judgment that the procession ordinance which he is charged with violating in the Corporation Court of the City of Nacogdoches is unconstitutional, the Court is confronted with the decision of the Supreme Court in Samuels v.

I have been in contact, not recently but some time ago, with the County and District Attorney, and I was abiding their decision in the matter.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: You are going to do whatever they do?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. ADAMS: Yes, sir.<\/blockquote>\n<p>A reference to the testimony of the District Attorney and the County Attorney, taken by deposition at the request of the Court, is revealing. The District Attorney, the Honorable David Adams, testified that he had no role, function, responsibility, or duties in the County Court of Nacogdoches County; that he prosecuted only in the District Courts; and that he had not presented to any grand jury any case of felony grade against McGuire for indictment, and knew of none to present.<\/p>\n<p>The following are extracts from the testimony of the Honorable Bryan Davis, County Attorney of Nacogdoches County:<\/p>\n<p>[Questions by Mr. Watts, attorney for the plaintiff:]<\/p>\n<blockquote>Q. How long have you been County Attorney of Nacogdoches County, Texas?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Since 1966.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>*   *   *   *   *   *<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Are you the prosecutor in the County Court of Nacogdoches County?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, sir.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And those complaints [against McGuire], if they are to be prosecuted, are to be prosecuted by you. Is that correct?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, I have sole responsibility for that.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Have those complaints been dismissed, at this time?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Are those complaints still active, pending trial?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, they are.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What are your responsibilities and duties regarding the calling of cases for trial in the County Court of Nacogdoches County?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I have no responsibility, of course, for setting the docket of the court.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Who sets the docket?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. The judge, the County Judge.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Has that been true since May 14th of 1970?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And who is the County Judge of Nacogdoches County, Texas?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. The County Judge is Carl S. Burrows.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And do you know how long Carl Burrows has been County Judge in Nacogdoches County?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. He has been in approximately two years. Two years this January.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Did he become County Judge of Nacogdoches County, pursuant to a run-off election held in June of 1970?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. He did.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And it is his sole responsibility to select the cases that will be placed upon the trial docket and to call those cases for trial in Nacogdoches County Court?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Do you know what the intentions are of the Court, at this time, for calling the five complaints lodged against Mr. McGuire, in that Court are, regarding trial or disposition of those causes?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No, sir. I do not, so far as being able to speak for the Court. What the Court's intentions are in the matter, I couldn't say.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What are your intentions regarding those complaints?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. My intentions at the present time are to treat them as I treat most of our other cases which are active pending cases on the docket. That is simply to, if asked by the Judge what my opinion is about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1123<\/span> setting them, I would give him my opinion.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What would your opinion be if he were to inquire?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. My opinion at this time would be . . . my personal opinion would be that it would serve no good end at this time, to try the cases.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Would it be your opinion or your recommendation to dismiss them?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. It would be your recommendation to simply hold them in abeyance until you felt the proper time had arrived for trial of those cases?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, sir.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>*   *   *   *   *   *<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. I would like to ask you this, since you testified a moment ago when Mr. Potter asked you the question regarding whether or not a fair and impartial trial could have occurred, immediately succeeding the filing of these complaints against Mr. McGuire, in the County Court and you said it was your opinion because of the air of emotionalism that prevailed at that time\u0097let me ask you this, do you think that that same attitude of emotionalism prevails at this date?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Since Mr. McGuire has removed himself from our midst, I don't feel that we have such tension as we had then. I think that we have a good deal left. I am not satisfied yet that there is such an absence of it that at this time, I would want to try the cases.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Judge Burrow's testimony was also taken by deposition at the direction of this court. A portion of it is as follows:<\/p>\n<p>[Questions by Mr. Watts, attorney for plaintiff:]<\/p>\n<blockquote>Q. You have one week for criminal trials per each 4-months session.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, sir.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And you have been County Judge now since January the 1st, 1971.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Right.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. To your knowledge, have any of these five criminal charges pending against Mr. McGuire been set for trial in County Court?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Have they ever been placed on any docket, any criminal docket in County Court?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. You mean before I went in there?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Since you have taken office?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Now, who in the County Court's office, either the clerk's or your office as County Judge, designates which criminal cases will be set for trial during the sessions per year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Me and the County Attorney.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. The County Attorney participates in that with you.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Does he actually take the lead or do you take the lead?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, both of us.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You consult with him which cases should be tried?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Have you had occasion to consult with him about setting any of these five cases charged against Mr. McGuire for trial?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No. Let me tell you something. When I went in office in 1971, there was a large backlog of cases on the docket. There hadn't been over a dozen cases tried in County Court in the last eight years.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Are you saying that these cases pending against Mr. McGuire have not been set for trial because of the backlog?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. We haven't caught up to them.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. When do you expect to catch up to them?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Maybe this Fall.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1124<\/span> Q. Do you have plans at this time for setting these cases for trial?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No specific plans.<\/blockquote>\n<p>[Questions by Mr. Potter, attorney for defendants:]<\/p>\n<blockquote>Q. Now, you have been asked by counsel when do you anticipate setting these cases. What do you intend to do about setting these cases? I'm asking you the same question.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I would like to try these cases some time this year.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Now, Judge Burrows, do you appreciate that a defendant is entitled to have his case tried?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Oh, yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Are you an attorney?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You do understand that a defendant is entitled to have his case tried?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And you say you would like to try them this year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Well, do you propose to do it this year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, if it is agreeable with the County Attorney.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. In other words, you are the judge of the court and you are the one to say whether you are going to try the case, or not. What if it is not agreeable with him? Are you going to try the cases this year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. If he is not agreeable and wouldn't, how could I?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Well, you can either try cases or you can dismiss them. You can dispose of the case, you see. Are you going to set the cases down and try them?<\/blockquote>\n<p>MR. WATTS: Let the witness say what he's going to do.<\/p>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, I will set them down.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. I mean do you intend to set the cases down this year?<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Now, when they are set down, at that time if the County Attorney is not ready, and I'm not asking you to pre-judge them or to say now what you are going to do at that time, but if you do set them down this year, will you decide at that time whether you are going to put the County Attorney to trial whether he wants to try them, or not. Otherwise, I want you to have this advise: That it is for the Judge to decide what he is going to do with the case when he sets it for trial and not the County Attorney.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, knowing the County Attorney like I do and the respect I have for him, I think he would respect my wishes enough to try the cases.<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is implicit from the statement of the County Attorney and the foregoing testimony that the City Attorney and the County Attorney entered into an agreement, tacit or otherwise, that so long as McGuire absented himself from Nacogdoches, neither would make any effort to bring him to trial, and this court so finds. Assuming McGuire's continued nonpresence in Nacogdoches, it is doubtful that the County Court prosecutions directed against him would ever have occurred, taking into account the fact that the lay County Judge was not cognizant of his power to set and to try cases without the concurrence of the County Attorney. Hence, it is this court's opinion that the bona fides of the prosecutions against McGuire in the County Court is subject to question.<\/p>\n<p>But regardless of the status of the prosecutions in County Court, the question before the court at this juncture is whether the prosecution in Corporation Court is being conducted in good faith. The City Attorney advanced no explanation or rationalization for his determination that he would abide by the decision of the County Attorney and the District Attorney respecting McGuire's continued prosecution in the Corporation Court, nor is this court able <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1125<\/span> to perceive any valid reason or justification for his decision. On the contrary, this court finds that the City Attorney is fully aware of the constitutional invalidity of the original procession ordinance, and that the purpose and effect of his failure to move for the dismissal of the charge against McGuire was and is to intimidate, threaten and coerce other blacks from exercising their constitutional rights to free speech and assembly.

It is thus unrealistic to assert that the controversy is moot as to McGuire.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, with reference to the third argument, it should be noted that this action is maintainable as a class action, the members of the class being those persons in Nacogdoches who desire to demonstrate lawfully on the streets of that city in behalf of civil rights for blacks.

The plaintiffs, black and white students at SFA, brought suit, <i>inter alia,<\/i> for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the City Commissioners, in selecting a date on which to submit to the voters an amendment to the City Charter of Nacogdoches that would drastically alter the manner of electing City Commissioners, could not choose a date during the three months summer vacation with the express purpose of significantly minimizing the number of voters of a particular class, <i>i. e.,<\/i> students and professors at SFA, that would vote on the amendment. The evidence showed that students and blacks had almost succeeded in electing two of their number to the City Commission at the last preceding election for municipal officers on April 4, 1972.

In one of his several impassioned speeches to black and white audiences in black churches in Nacogdoches, McGuire, observing the presence of Crawford, made extremely uncomplimentary and vile references to the F.B.I. When one of McGuire's speeches was reported to Roebuck by Crawford, Roebuck stated that he \"could put an end to the nigger situation by putting a 30-30 bullet between [McGuire's] eyes.\"<\/p>\n<p>[6]  She afterwards plead guilty to the offenses in the District Court of Nacogdoches County.<\/p>\n<p>[7]  Upon being told by Roebuck at the police station that Miss Dorsey's arrest was \"none of his business\", McGuire angrily declared: \"I'll burn this damn town down around your neck.\" Roebuck obviously regarded the threat with some seriousness, but he took no action on it. However, the threat was made the basis of a criminal complaint filed against McGuire in the County Court of Nacogdoches County on May 14, 1970.<\/p>\n<p>[8]  The placards and signs read as follows:\n<\/p>\n<p>\"End discrimination\"; \"Respect the black\"; \"Don't rob the poor\"; \"Together we stand, divided we fall\"; \"Blacks want equal rights\"; \"Let's live together\"; and \"Hunger is a felony\".<\/p>\n<p>[9]  Orton Hill had very few sidewalks, and the streets were largely unpaved.<\/p>\n<p>[10]  The charges against McGuire were: (1) knowingly and wilfully committing an act, that is, \"leading and urging on a mob by gestures and loud shouting, which under the circumstances was reasonably calculated to and did produce a clear and present and immediate threat to the property of another\"; (2) \"disorderly conduct, to-wit, by engaging in behavior of a boisterous and tumultuous character, to-wit, by shouting, screaming and yelling in a public place . . . in such a manner as to create a clear and present danger of alarming persons where no legitimate reason for alarm exists\"; (3) \"by threatening words, to-wit: `I'll burn this damn town down around your neck', [McGuire] attempted to prevent M.

WALLACE TASHIMA, SUSAN P. GRABER and JAY S. BYBEE, Circuit Judges.<\/p>\n<p>BYBEE, Circuit Judge:<\/p>\n<p>Defendant-Appellant Rayford L. Terrell was convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court enhanced Terrell's sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921-31, which raises the mandatory minimum sentence for convicted felons in possession of a firearm who have \"three previous convictions ... for a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Terrell argues that the prior convictions relied upon for the enhancement\u0097sexual assault under Arizona law, second-degree burglary under Arizona law, and second-degree burglary under Missouri law\u0097do not qualify as \"violent felon[ies]\" under the ACCA. We hold that all of these prior offenses fit categorically within the ACCA's residual clause in that they \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, we affirm the district court's decision to enhance Terrell's sentence.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>I<\/h2>\n<p>On May 31, 2005, as part of a large-scale operation to identify drug and firearm dealers, Phoenix Police Detective Matthew Shay met with Terrell, claiming that he wanted to purchase firearms. After several subsequent discussions and meetings with Terrell and with Terrell's co-defendant, Cindy O'Quinn, Shay purchased a.380 caliber pistol from Terrell.<\/p>\n<p>On September 20, 2006, Terrell was charged in the District of Arizona with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The indictment also alleged that, at the time of the offense, Terrell had previously been convicted of at least three felony offenses: (1) Burglary in the Second Degree on or about November 23, 1988, in Maricopa County, Arizona; (2) Sexual Assault on or about September 8, 1992, in Maricopa County, Arizona; and (3) Burglary in the Second Degree on or about March 3, 1993, in St. Louis County, Missouri. Following a two-day trial, the jury found Terrell guilty as charged.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1087<\/span> The Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") found that Terrell had \"committed the instant offense subsequent to sustaining three felony convictions for crimes of violence, as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\" According to the PSR, these prior convictions made Terrell \"an Armed Career Criminal within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 and[therefore] subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e),\" the ACCA.<sup>[1]<\/sup> These determinations resulted in an offense level of thirty-three. The PSR then found that Terrell's offense level of thirty-three and criminal history category of VI resulted in a Sentencing Guidelines range of 235 to 293 months.<\/p>\n<p>Terrell objected to the PSR, arguing that the alleged prior felony convictions were not \"violent felon[ies]\" and therefore that Terrell was not subject to an enhanced sentence under the ACCA. The district court overruled Terrell's objections to the PSR and held that Terrell's prior convictions qualified him as an armed career criminal under the ACCA. The court stated:<\/p>\n<blockquote>I think ... the whole approach to the categorization of prior offenses as crimes of violence ... is really needlessly complex.... And the case law that has developed ... contributes, I think, to the wholesale confusion in this area.... We, I think, intuitively know what Congress is trying to do, and yet given all the gloss and all the complexity, its intent is sometimes frustrated.... [I]t strikes me that at the end of the day, whether [Terrell's prior offenses] fit nicely within the categorical approach or the modified categorical approach, that, at a minimum, they fit within the residual clause of [the ACCA] as violent felonies.<\/blockquote>\n<p>However, the court granted the government's motion for a downward departure of two levels for substantial assistance and sentenced Terrell at the low end of the post-departure Guidelines range: 188 months' imprisonment, followed by a five-year term of supervised release. Terrell timely appealed.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>II<\/h2>\n<p>Terrell argues that the district court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence under the ACCA, contending that his prior felony convictions do not qualify as \"violent felon[ies].\"<sup>[2]<\/sup> \"We review de novo whether a prior conviction is a predicate felony under the ACCA.\" <i>United States v. Grisel,<\/i> 488 F.3d 844, 846 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). We first review the complex statutory and legal framework governing this case.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1088<\/span> Terrell was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), which prohibits previously convicted felons from possessing firearms. In the ordinary case, the maximum penalty for violating \u00a7 922(g) is a fine and imprisonment for up to ten years. <i>See<\/i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, a defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) who \"has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony\" is subject to a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence. <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as<\/p>\n<blockquote>any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that\u0097<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another[.]<\/blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).<\/p>\n<p>The government has conceded that none of Terrell's prior convictions fits within the first provision of the \"violent felony\" definition\u0097those felonies that \"ha[ve] as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Thus, for each of Terrell's prior convictions, we must apply the categorical and, if appropriate, modified categorical approach to determine whether the state offense fits within one of two portions of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (\"subsection (ii)\"). <i>See <\/i><i>Taylor v. United States,<\/i> 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). First, we must determine whether the prior felony fits within the enumerated offenses in subsection (ii): burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes that involve the use of explosives. <i>See<\/i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). If not, we must determine, second, whether the prior felony fits within subsection (ii)'s residual clause, in that it \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Our analysis of whether Terrell's prior convictions fit within the <i>residual<\/i> clause contains a unique element because of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Begay v. United States,<\/i> 553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). In <i>Begay,<\/i> the Supreme Court determined that subsection (ii)'s enumerated offenses\u0097burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives\u0097\"indicate[ ] that the statute covers only <i>similar<\/i> crimes, rather than <i>every<\/i> crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 1585 (internal quotation marks omitted). In order to give effect to all of the words in subsection (ii), the Court held that the enumerated offenses \"limit[ ] the crimes that clause (ii) covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves.\" <i>Id.<\/i> The Court noted further that the enumerated crimes \"all typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 1586 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, even if Terrell's offenses \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), we must determine whether these crimes are \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses\u0097that is, whether they \"typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>III<\/h2>\n<p>We now address, in turn, whether Terrell's sexual assault and burglary convictions fit within the ACCA's \"violent felony\" definition.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1089<\/span> A<\/h2>\n<p>Arizona law provides that \"[a] person commits sexual assault by intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact with any person <i>without consent<\/i> of such person.\" ARIZ. REV. STAT. \u00a7 13-1406(A) (emphasis added). The statute defines \"without consent\" to include circumstances in which \"[t]he victim is coerced by the immediate use or threatened use of force against a person or property.\" <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(a). However, it also includes circumstances in which no force or threat of force is used, including where \"[t]he victim is incapable of consent\" because of mental disorder, drugs, or other similar impairments known to the defendant, <i>id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(b); where \"[t]he victim is intentionally deceived as to the nature of the act,\" <i>id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(c); or where \"[t]he victim is intentionally deceived to erroneously believe that the person is the victim's spouse,\" <i>id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(d).<\/p>\n<p>Sexual assault is not one of the enumerated offenses in subsection (ii). Thus, we must decide whether Terrell's sexual assault offense fits within the residual clause. This determination requires us to determine: (1) whether the offense \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); and (2) whether sexual assault under Arizona law is \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that it \"typically involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>1<\/h2>\n<p>Regarding the categorical approach, Terrell argues that, because the Arizona sexual assault statute does not require force or coercion, but rather a person can be convicted of sexual assault even if the victim permits the intercourse, his prior sexual assault offense does not fit categorically within the residual clause. This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <i>United States v. Riley,<\/i> 183 F.3d 1155 (9th Cir.1999).<\/p>\n<p>In <i>Riley,<\/i> we held that a conviction for \"attempted simple rape\" under Louisiana law qualified categorically as a \"crime of violence\" in that it involved conduct that presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <i>Id.<\/i> at 1159. Like the Arizona sexual assault statute, the Louisiana simple rape statute included circumstances in which no coercion or force was used, such as when the victim did not understand the nature of the act by reason of drugs or \"unsoundness of mind,\" or when the victim submitted to the intercourse based on the belief that the defendant was her husband. <i>See id.<\/i> at 1158. We reasoned that the personal contact inherently involved in simple rape \"coupled with the nature of this offense creates an atmosphere that fosters the potential for physical confrontation,\" so that \"[e]ven in its least violent form, simple rape ... could result in physical injury to the victim.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 1159.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense, Terrell's case is indistinguishable from <i>Riley,<\/i> and thus he argues only that <i>Riley<\/i> is no longer good law in light of <i>Begay.<\/i> It is true that <i>Riley<\/i> (which was decided before <i>Begay<\/i>) did not consider whether the Louisiana simple rape offense was \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses, and thus left open the question whether the Arizona sexual assault statute satisfies the <i>Begay<\/i> analysis. However, <i>Begay<\/i> does not affect the <i>Riley<\/i> court's determination that simple rape (a similar offense to sexual assault under Arizona law) involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another even if it can be committed with the permission of the victim. Whether the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1090<\/span> Arizona statute satisfies <i>Begay<\/i>'s \"roughly similar\" test is an issue separate from the issue whether the statute involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <i>See <\/i><i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585 (stating that the presence of the enumerated offenses \"indicates that the statute covers only <i>similar<\/i> crimes, rather than <i>every<\/i> crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We turn now to the <i>Begay<\/i> analysis.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>2<\/h2>\n<p>We have not decided the issue framed by <i>Begay:<\/i> whether sexual assault \"typically involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 1586 (internal quotation marks omitted). Terrell argues that sexual assault under Arizona law does not satisfy this test because a defendant can be convicted under the Arizona statute even if the intercourse occurs with the victim's permission, such as when the defendant deceives the victim into thinking that the defendant is the victim's spouse. He relies primarily on our decision in <i>United States v. Christensen,<\/i> 559 F.3d 1092 (9th Cir.2009).<\/p>\n<p>In <i>Christensen,<\/i> we held that the defendant's conviction for <i>statutory<\/i> rape under Washington law did not constitute a \"violent felony\" under <i>Begay. <\/i><i>Christensen,<\/i> 559 F.3d at 1095. Under Washington law, a person could be guilty of statutory rape simply by having sexual intercourse with a person of a certain age, regardless of whether the victim consented to the intercourse. <i>See id.<\/i> at 1093. We first noted that, \"[b]ecause the Court in <i>Begay<\/i> used the conjunction `and,' all three of its criteria\u0097'purposeful, violent, and aggressive'\u0097 must be satisfied.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 1095. We then held that, \"because statutory rape may involve consensual sexual intercourse, it does not necessarily involve either `violent' or `aggressive' conduct.\" <i>Id.<\/i> (citation omitted).<\/p>\n<p>Terrell's case is distinguishable from <i>Christensen<\/i> in three crucial ways. First, whereas the \"typical\" case of statutory rape does not involve violent and aggressive conduct, the \"typical\" case of ordinary sexual assault does indeed involve violent and aggressive conduct. Pure <i>statutory<\/i> rape laws like the law in <i>Christensen<\/i> are generally designed to target precisely the kind of situation that does <i>not<\/i> involve violent or aggressive conduct. Their purpose is instead to target defendants whose sexual partners are, by law, considered too young to give lawful consent.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, simple rape is \"a <i>violent<\/i> crime because it <i>normally involves force,<\/i> or the threat of force or intimidation, to overcome the will and the capacity of the victim to resist. Rape is <i>very often<\/i> accompanied by physical injury to the female and can also inflict mental and psychological damage.\" <i>Coker v. Georgia,<\/i> 433 U.S. 584, 597-98, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977) (emphases added). It is true that some sexual assault statutes, like the Arizona statute, have been drawn in such a way as to sweep in <i>some<\/i> cases that do not necessarily involve violence or aggression, such as when the defendant deceives the victim. However, this extra coverage does not change the fact that the \"typical\" case of sexual assault does involve violent and aggressive actions by the defendant. <i>See id.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Second, even in those cases where the rape is \"achieved by trickery or deception,\" that fact \"does not erase the everpresent possibility that the victim may figure out what's really going on and decide to resist, in turn requiring the perpetrator to resort to actual physical restraint\" that could then \"easily escalate into a <i>violent<\/i> confrontation.\" <i>Riley,<\/i> 183 F.3d at 1159 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1091<\/span> added). In this sense, the ordinary case of sexual assault involves at least as much violence and aggression as the ordinary case of burglary. Generic burglary, after all, is often accomplished in cases where no one other than the defendant is present in the structure being burglarized, and thus a violent confrontation will occur only if someone arrives and discovers the defendant. In contrast, \"[p]ersonal contact is, of course, part and parcel of simple rape,\" <i>id.<\/i> at 1158, making the potential for face-to-face physical confrontation more likely in \"deceptive\" sexual assault cases than in the ordinary case of burglary.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the typical case of statutory rape does not involve this same risk of violent escalation. Ordinarily, there is nothing that the victim is likely to \"figure out,\" <i>id.<\/i> at 1159, during the sexual activity that would cause the situation to escalate into violence. Thus, sexual assault under Arizona law is very different from the statute in <i>Christensen<\/i> despite the fact that both statutes punish certain kinds of sexual activity.<\/p>\n<p>Third, the <i>Christensen<\/i> court relied explicitly on the fact that \"statutory rape may involve <i>consensual<\/i> sexual intercourse\" in finding that it did \"not necessarily involve either `violent' or `aggressive' conduct.\" 559 F.3d at 1095 (emphasis added). The Arizona sexual assault statute explicitly requires that the defendant engage in sexual activity \"<i>without consent<\/i>\" of the victim. ARIZ. REV. STAT. \u00a7 13-1406(A) (emphasis added). Although Arizona law defines \"without consent\" to include certain circumstances where no force or coercion is used, <i>see id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(b)-(d), a lack of consent on the part of the victim is an express element of Arizona sexual assault, which was not the case in <i>Christensen.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\"Short of homicide, [rape] is the ultimate violation of self,\" <i>Coker,<\/i> 433 U.S. at 597, 97 S.Ct. 2861 (internal quotation marks omitted), and apart from homicide it is hard to imagine any crime that has a greater tendency to \"involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1586. Thus, we hold that Terrell's prior sexual assault conviction qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA's residual clause because it \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and is \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that it typically \"involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1586.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>B<\/h2>\n<p>We turn now to Terrell's burglary convictions. Terrell was convicted of second-degree burglary under both Arizona and Missouri law. Arizona law provides that \"[a] person commits burglary in the second degree by entering or remaining unlawfully in or on a <i>residential structure<\/i> with the intent to commit any theft or any felony therein.\" ARIZ. REV. STAT. \u00a7 13-1507(A) (emphasis added). Importantly, a separate provision defines the term \"residential structure\" to mean \"any structure, <i>movable<\/i> or immovable, permanent or temporary, that is adapted for both human residence and lodging whether occupied or not.\" <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1501(11) (emphasis added). Finally, the statute defines \"structure\" to include \"any vending machine or any building, object, vehicle, railroad car or place with sides and a floor that is separately securable from any other structure attached to it.\" <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1501(12).<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Missouri law provides that \"[a] person commits the crime of burglary in the second degree when he knowingly enters unlawfully or knowingly remains unlawfully in a <i>building or inhabitable structure<\/i> for the purpose of committing a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1092<\/span> crime therein.\" MO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 569.170(1) (emphasis added). Missouri Revised Statute section 569.010(2), in turn, also includes movable objects in the burglary definition, providing that the term \"inhabitable structure\" includes \"a ship, trailer, sleeping car, airplane, or other vehicle or structure\" where people live, conduct business, assemble, or stay overnight.<\/p>\n<p>We now address, in turn, whether these state burglary offenses fit within either the enumerated offenses or residual clause of subsection (ii) of the ACCA's \"violent felony\" definition. We hold that, although Terrell's prior burglary offenses do not fit within the enumerated offenses, they do fit within the residual clause.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>1<\/h2>\n<p>Burglary is one of the enumerated offenses in subsection (ii) of the ACCA. <i>See<\/i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). In determining whether Terrell's prior burglary offenses fit within the burglary offense enumerated in the ACCA, we must apply the categorical and modified categorical approaches to compare Terrell's prior burglary offenses to the \"generic\" definition of burglary set forth in <i>Taylor,<\/i> which contains three elements: \"[1] unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, [2] a building or structure, [3] with intent to commit a crime.\" 495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143.<\/p>\n<p>Because the government has conceded that Terrell's burglary convictions do not fit categorically within the generic burglary definition, our inquiry is whether, under the modified categorical approach, judicially recognized documents show that Terrell was necessarily convicted of generic burglary. <i>See <\/i><i>Shepard v. United States,<\/i> 544 U.S. 13, 15-16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).<\/p>\n<p>With respect to Terrell's Arizona burglary conviction, the prosecution submitted an indictment, plea agreement, and judgment to the district court. The indictment alleges that Terrell, \"on or about the 7th day of October, 1986, with intent to commit a theft or a felony therein, entered or remained unlawfully in or on the residential structure of L_______ M_________, located at 2__________ N. 13th St.\"<sup>[3]<\/sup> This indictment simply uses the same \"residential structure\" wording as the Arizona burglary statute, which includes both movable and unmovable structures. <i>See<\/i> ARIZ. REV. STAT. \u00a7 13-1501(11). It does not indicate whether the structure was \"intended for use in one place\" as opposed to movable, as is required by the generic burglary definition. <i>Grisel,<\/i> 488 F.3d at 848. The indictment also does not indicate whether or not the \"intent to commit the crime was formed after entering the structure and\/or the entry was privileged.\" <i>United States v. Bonat,<\/i> 106 F.3d 1472, 1475 (9th Cir. 1997) (noting that \"Arizona courts have expanded the statute beyond generic burglary [by interpreting] the statute to allow a conviction even if the intent to commit the crime was formed after entering the structure and\/or the entry was privileged\"). The plea agreement and judgment are even less informative. The plea agreement simply refers to the offense as \"Count III: Burglary in the Second Degree, A Class 3 Felony,\" while the judgment refers to the offense as \"Count III \u0097 Burglary 2nd Degree committed while on probation.\"<\/p>\n<p>Regarding Terrell's Missouri burglary convictions, the prosecution provided copies of the charging documents, plea agreements, and judgment. None of those documents provides any indication of whether Terrell entered an unmovable structure as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1093<\/span> opposed to a ship, airplane, or other movable structure. <i>See<\/i> MO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 569.010(2) (including in its \"burglary\" definition \"ship[s], trailer[s], sleeping car[s], airplane[s], [and] other vehicle[s] or structure[s]\"). One charging document stated that Terrell \"knowingly entered unlawfully[an] inhabitable structure, located at 8_______ Cranberry Lane, and possessed by G________ L___________, for the purpose of committing stealing therein.\" Another stated essentially the same thing except for a different address and owner. The plea agreements and judgment simply referred to Terrell's offenses as burglary in the second degree, a Class C felony.<\/p>\n<p>In sum, the documents submitted by the prosecution do not demonstrate that Terrell was necessarily convicted of burglary of an unmovable structure, so under the modified categorical approach, Terrell's prior offenses do not fit within the ACCA's enumerated offenses.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>2<\/h2>\n<p>We turn now to the residual clause. To determine whether Terrell's burglary convictions fit within subsection (ii)'s residual clause, we must answer two questions: (1) whether the prior offenses \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); and (2) if the first question is answered in the affirmative, whether Terrell's prior offenses are \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that they \"typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted).<\/p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has emphasized that the categorical approach does not \"requir[e] that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony.\" <i>James v. United States,<\/i> 550 U.S. 192, 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). \"Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\" <i>Id.<\/i> In light of these considerations, the Arizona and Missouri burglary offenses fit easily within the ACCA's residual clause.<\/p>\n<p>Terrell argues that, because the state statutes may be violated by \"entering a temporary, unoccupied structure,\" these offenses involve a lower risk of injury than generic burglary. And regarding the Arizona statute in particular, Terrell argues that, because the statute \"lacks the element of criminal intent formed prior to entry, it does not embody the same risks as the generic burglary.\"<\/p>\n<p>Neither of these arguments is persuasive, because the Supreme Court and this court have consistently held that burglary involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, even in cases where the relevant state statutes were missing the same elements of generic burglary that are missing from the Arizona and Missouri burglary statutes in this case. In <i>James,<\/i> the Supreme Court held that Florida's attempted burglary offense fit within subsection (ii)'s residual clause even though the offense did not even require <i>entry<\/i> into a structure, let alone the \"unlawful\" entry required by <i>Taylor. See <\/i><i>James,<\/i> 550 U.S. at 195, 197, 127 S.Ct. 1586. The Court emphasized that \"[t]he main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another's property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586. Similarly, the lack of a requirement of unlawful intent prior to entry in Arizona <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1094<\/span> burglary law does not change the fact that committing the offense, \"in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586.<\/p>\n<p>As for the lack of an \"unmovable structure\" requirement, the argument that this omission precludes a burglary offense from fitting categorically within the residual clause is foreclosed in by our decision in <i>United States v. Mayer,<\/i> 560 F.3d 948 (9th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,<\/i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 158, 175 L.Ed.2d 100 (2009). In <i>Mayer,<\/i> we held that first-degree burglary in Oregon was categorically a violent felony under the residual clause even though Oregon's definition of \"building\" included vehicles, aircrafts, and other movable structures, and was thus broader than <i>Taylor<\/i>'s generic definition. <i>See id.<\/i> at 954, 959. We relied on <i>James<\/i> to find that \"[t]he risk of potential injury due to a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party is not lessened simply because, under Oregon law, the dwelling does not have to be a generic `building' or `structure.'\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 963. Similarly, committing burglary under Arizona or Missouri law presents a serious potential risk of physical injury despite the statutes' broad definitions of \"structure.\" <i>See <\/i><i>United States v. Cantrell,<\/i> 530 F.3d 684, 695-96 (8th Cir.2008) (holding that Missouri's second-degree burglary offense was categorically a \"crime of violence\" under the residual clause of the Guidelines' definition despite its broad definition of \"inhabitable structure,\" because of \"the risk of a violent confrontation between [the defendant] and the occupant, the police, or another third party\").<\/p>\n<p>Having decided that Terrell's burglary offenses fit categorically within subsection (ii)'s residual clause, we must determine whether these offenses are \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that they \"typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have little difficulty concluding that they are. Simply put, it is hard to imagine that a state's \"burglary\" definition would not be at least \"roughly similar\" to generic \"burglary.\" Terrell argues, however, that \"it is not enough to look at the label of the offense.\" He argues that, because the state burglary definitions include movable structures, the crimes of which Terrell was convicted are not \"similar, in kind as well as in degree of risks posed, to the examples themselves.\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585. He also contends that, because \"a lawful entry into a building poses a lesser risk than forced entry,\" the Arizona statute's lack of a requirement of criminal intent formed prior to entry means that Arizona burglary \"does not necessarily involve violent, aggressive behavior.\"<\/p>\n<p>There are two problems with Terrell's argument. First, it conflicts with <i>James<\/i> and <i>Mayer.<\/i> In <i>Mayer,<\/i> we held that Oregon's first-degree burglary statute satisfied the <i>Begay<\/i> test despite its inclusion of movable \"buildings,\" reasoning that a burglar's entry into movable buildings \"typically involves, much like generic burglary,... `purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.'\" <i>Mayer,<\/i> 560 F.3d at 962 (quoting <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1586). And with respect to the Arizona statute's lack of a requirement of criminal intent formed prior to entry, <i>James<\/i> (although decided before <i>Begay<\/i>) conducted a similar analysis to the <i>Begay<\/i> test in finding that \"the risk posed by attempted burglary is <i>comparable<\/i> to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses\u0097here, completed burglary.\" <i>James,<\/i> 550 U.S. at 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (emphasis added). The Court found that, even though Florida's attempted burglary offense did not require <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1095<\/span> any entry into a structure, it posed the same kinds of risks as generic burglary because of the dangerous \"possibility of a face-to-face confrontation\" with a third party involved in any burglary. <i>Id.<\/i> Given that the Arizona law does not require \"unlawful entry\" but still requires \"entry,\" making it even more like generic burglary than the statute in <i>James,<\/i> we reject Terrell's argument that the Arizona statute is not \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary.<\/p>\n<p>The second problem with Terrell's argument is that it essentially converts the <i>Begay<\/i> analysis into a restatement of the question whether the offense of conviction fits categorically within subsection (ii)'s enumerated offenses. Given our determinations thus far, Terrell's <i>Begay<\/i> argument would result in the following three-step analysis: (1) Terrell's burglary offenses do not fit categorically within the enumerated offenses; (2) Terrell's burglary offenses fit categorically within subsection (ii)'s residual clause\u0097that is, in the ordinary case, burglary presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another; (3) under <i>Begay,<\/i> Terrell's burglary offenses are not \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary because they cover a broader range of conduct than the enumerated burglary offense. Under this logic, the <i>Begay<\/i> analysis (step 3) is not meaningfully different from the determination of whether the burglary convictions fit categorically within the enumerated offenses (step 1), a result that renders the residual clause (and step 2) meaningless. The more plausible interpretation of <i>Begay<\/i> is that a state burglary offense is almost always at least \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary even if the state offense is somewhat broader.<sup>[4]<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Thus, we hold that Terrell's Arizona and Missouri burglary convictions qualify as \"violent felon[ies]\" under the residual clause because they \"involve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and are \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary, <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>IV<\/h2>\n<p>Because the district court correctly held that Terrell had been convicted of at least three \"violent felon[ies]\" at the time he committed his felon in possession offense, we affirm the district court's decision to enhance Terrell's sentence under the ACCA.<\/p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.<\/p>\n<h2>NOTES<\/h2>\n<p>[1]  The definition of \"violent felony\" under the ACCA is nearly identical to the definition of \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Guidelines, so we have interpreted these provisions in a \"parallel manner.\" <i>United States v. Jennings,<\/i> 515 F.3d 980, 990 n. 11 (9th Cir.2008). In order to avoid confusion, we will discuss Terrell's convictions in terms of the ACCA, but the analysis applies equally to \u00a7 4B1.2.<\/p>\n<p>[2]  Terrell also argues that the enhancement of his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment because the prosecution did not prove his prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He argues that the Supreme Court's rule announced in <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,<\/i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), namely that prior convictions need not be proved to a jury, <i>see id.<\/i> at 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, has been called into question by the Court's subsequent decisions in <i>Jones v.

After several subsequent discussions and meetings with Terrell and with Terrell\u2019s co-defendant, Cindy O\u2019Quinn, Shay purchased a .380 caliber pistol from Terrell.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1110-14\">\n  On September 20, 2006, Terrell was charged in the District of Arizona with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The indictment also alleged that, at the time of the offense, Terrell had previously been convicted of at least three felony offenses: (1) Burglary in the Second Degree on or about November 23, 1988, in Maricopa County, Arizona; (2) Sexual Assault on or about September 8, 1992, in Maricopa County, Arizona; and (3) Burglary in the Second Degree on or about March 3, 1993, in St. Louis County, Missouri. Following a two-day trial, the jury found Terrell guilty as charged.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">\n<span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1087\"> \n   *1087\n   <\/span>\n  The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) found that Terrell had \u201ccommitted the instant offense subsequent to sustaining three felony convictions for crimes of violence, as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4131.2(a).\u201d According to the PSR, these prior convictions made Terrell \u201can Armed Career Criminal within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 and[therefore] subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e),\u201d the ACCA.\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">\n   1\n  <\/a>\n  These determinations resulted in an offense level of thirty-three.

The district court overruled Terrell\u2019s objections to the PSR and held that Terrell\u2019s prior convictions qualified him as an armed career criminal under the ACCA. The court stated:\n <\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-6\">\n  I think ... the whole approach to the categorization of prior offenses as crimes of violence ... is really needlessly complex____ And the case law that has developed ... contributes, I think, to the wholesale confusion in this area....

He relies primarily on our decision in\n  <em>\n   United States v. Christensen,\n  <\/em>\n  559 F.3d 1092 (9th Cir.2009).\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">\n  In\n  <em>\n   Christensen,\n  <\/em>\n  we held that the defendant\u2019s conviction for\n  <em>\n   statutory\n  <\/em>\n  rape under Washington law did not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under\n  <em>\n   Begay. Christensen,\n  <\/em>\n  559 F.3d at 1095. Under Washington law, a person could be guilty of statutory rape simply by having sexual intercourse with a person of a certain age, regardless of whether the victim consented to the intercourse.\n  <em>\n   See id.\n  <\/em>\n  at 1093. We first noted that, \u201c[bjecause the Court in\n  <em>\n   Begay\n  <\/em>\n  used the conjunction \u2018and,\u2019 all three of its criteria\u2014\u2018purposeful, violent, and aggressive\u2019\u2014 must be satisfied.\u201d\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  <\/em>\n  at 1095. We then held that, \u201cbecause statutory rape may involve consensual sexual intercourse, it does not necessarily involve either \u2018violent\u2019 or \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  <\/em>\n  (citation omitted).\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">\n  Terrell\u2019s ease is distinguishable from\n  <em>\n   Christensen\n  <\/em>\n  in three crucial ways. First, whereas the \u201ctypical\u201d case of statutory rape does not involve violent and aggressive conduct, the \u201ctypical\u201d case of ordinary sexual assault does indeed involve violent and aggressive conduct. Pure\n  <em>\n   statutory\n  <\/em>\n  rape laws like the law in\n  <em>\n   Christensen\n  <\/em>\n  are generally designed to target precisely the kind of situation that does\n  <em>\n   not\n  <\/em>\n  involve violent or aggressive conduct. Their purpose is instead to target defendants whose sexual partners are, by law, considered too young to give lawful consent.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">\n  In contrast, simple rape is \u201ca\n  <em>\n   violent\n  <\/em>\n  crime because it\n  <em>\n   normally involves force,\n  <\/em>\n  or the threat of force or intimidation, to overcome the will and the capacity of the victim to resist. Rape is\n  <em>\n   very often\n  <\/em>\n  accompanied by physical injury to the female and can also inflict mental and psychological damage.\u201d\n  <em>\n   Coker v. Georgia,\n  <\/em>\n  433 U.S. 584, 597-98, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977) (emphases added). It is true that some sexual assault statutes, like the Arizona statute, have been drawn in such a way as to sweep in\n  <em>\n   some\n  <\/em>\n  cases that do not necessarily involve violence or aggression, such as when the defendant deceives the victim. However, this extra coverage does not change the fact that the \u201ctypical\u201d case of sexual assault does involve violent and aggressive actions by the defendant.\n  <em>\n   See id.\n  <\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">\n  Second, even in those cases where the rape is \u201cachieved by trickery or deception,\u201d that fact \u201cdoes not erase the ever-present possibility that the victim may figure out what\u2019s really going on and decide to resist, in turn requiring the perpetrator to resort to actual physical restraint\u201d that could then \u201ceasily escalate into a\n  <em>\n   violent\n  <\/em>\n  confrontation.\u201d\n  <em>\n   Riley,\n  <\/em>\n  183 F.3d at 1159 (internal quotation marks omitted) (em\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1091\"> \n   *1091\n   <\/span>\n  phasis added). In this sense, the ordinary-case of sexual assault involves at least as much violence and aggression as the ordinary case of burglary. Generic burglary, after all, is often accomplished in cases where no one other than the defendant is present in the structure being burglarized, and thus a violent confrontation will occur only if someone arrives and discovers the defendant. In contrast, \u201c[p]ersonal contact is, of course, part and parcel of simple rape,\u201d\n  <em>\n   id.\n  <\/em>\n  at 1158, making the potential for face-to-face physical confrontation more likely in \u201cdeceptive\u201d sexual assault cases than in the ordinary case of burglary.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">\n  On the other hand, the typical case of statutory rape does not involve this same risk of violent escalation. Ordinarily, there is nothing that the victim is likely to \u201cfigure out,\u201d\n  <em>\n   id.\n  <\/em>\n  at 1159, during the sexual activity that would cause the situation to escalate into violence. Thus, sexual assault under Arizona law is very different from the statute in\n  <em>\n   Christensen\n  <\/em>\n  despite the fact that both statutes punish certain kinds of sexual activity.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">\n  Third, the\n  <em>\n   Christensen\n  <\/em>\n  court relied explicitly on the fact that \u201cstatutory rape may involve\n  <em>\n   consensual\n  <\/em>\n  sexual intercourse\u201d in finding that it did \u201cnot necessarily involve either \u2018violent\u2019 or \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d 559 F.3d at 1095 (emphasis added).

In determining whether Terrell\u2019s prior burglary offenses fit within the burglary offense enumerated in the ACCA, we must apply the categorical and modified categorical approaches to compare Terrell\u2019s prior burglary offenses to the \u201cgeneric\u201d definition of burglary set forth in\n  <em>\n   Taylor,\n  <\/em>\n  which contains three elements: \u201c[1] unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, [2] a building or structure, [3] with intent to commit a crime.\u201d 495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">\n  Because the government has conceded that Terrell\u2019s burglary convictions do not fit categorically within the generic burglary definition, our inquiry is whether, under the modified categorical approach, judicially recognized documents show that Terrell was necessarily convicted of generic burglary.\n  <em>\n   See Shepard v.

The indictment alleges that Terrell, \u201con or about the 7th day of October, 1986, with intent to commit a theft or a felony therein, entered or remained unlawfully in or on the residential structure of L_M_, located at 2_N. 13th St.\u201d\n  <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">\n   3\n  <\/a>\n  This indictment simply uses the same \u201cresidential structure\u201d wording as the Arizona burglary statute, which includes both movable and unmovable structures.\n  <em>\n   See\n  <\/em>\n  Ariz.

The plea agreement and judgment are even less informative. The plea agreement simply refers to the offense as \u201cCount III: Burglary in the Second Degree, A Class 3 Felony,\u201d while the judgment refers to the offense as \u201cCount III - Burglary 2nd Degree committed while on probation.\u201d\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">\n  Regarding Terrell\u2019s Missouri burglary convictions, the prosecution provided copies of the charging documents, plea agreements, and judgment.

The plea agreements and judgment simply referred to Terrell\u2019s offenses as burglary in the second degree, a Class C felony.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">\n  In sum, the documents submitted by the prosecution do not demonstrate that Terrell was necessarily convicted of burglary of an unmovable structure, so under the modified categorical -approach, Terrell\u2019s prior offenses do not fit within the ACCA\u2019s enumerated offenses.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">\n  2\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">\n  We turn now to the residual clause. To determine whether Terrell\u2019s burglary convictions fit within subsection (ii)\u2019s residual clause, we must answer two questions: (1) whether the prior offenses \u201cinvolve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); and (2) if the first question is answered in the affirmative, whether Terrell\u2019s prior offenses are \u201croughly similar\u201d to the enumerated offenses in that they \u201ctypically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\u201d\n  <em>\n   Begay,\n  <\/em>\n  128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">\n  The Supreme Court has emphasized that the categorical approach does not \u201crequir[e] that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony.\u201d\n  <em>\n   James v. United States,\n  <\/em>\n  550 U.S. 192, 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). \u201cRather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  <\/em>\n  In light of these considerations, the Arizona and Missouri burglary offenses fit easily within the ACCA\u2019s residual clause.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">\n  Terrell argues that, because the state statutes may be violated by \u201centering a temporary, unoccupied structure,\u201d these offenses involve a lower risk of injury than generic burglary. And regarding the Arizona statute in particular, Terrell argues that, because the statute \u201clacks the element of criminal intent formed prior to entry, it does not embody the same risks as the generic burglary.\u201d\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">\n  Neither of these arguments is persuasive, because the Supreme Court and this court have consistently held that burglary involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, even in cases where the relevant state statutes were missing the same elements of generic burglary that are missing from the Arizona and Missouri burglary statutes in this case. In\n  <em>\n   James,\n  <\/em>\n  the Supreme Court held that Florida\u2019s attempted burglary offense fit within subsection (ii)\u2019s residual clause even though the offense did not even require\n  <em>\n   entry\n  <\/em>\n  into a structure, let alone the \u201cunlawful\u201d entry required by\n  <em>\n   Taylor. See James,\n  <\/em>\n  550 U.S. at 195, 197, 127 S.Ct. 1586. The Court emphasized that \u201c[t]he main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another\u2019s property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party.\u201d\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  <\/em>\n  at 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586. Similarly, the lack of a requirement of unlawful intent prior to entry in Arizona\n  <span citation-index=\"1\" class=\"star-pagination\" label=\"1094\"> \n   *1094\n   <\/span>\n  burglary law does not change the fact that committing the offense, \u201cin the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  <\/em>\n  at 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586.\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">\n  As for the lack of an \u201cunmovable structure\u201d requirement, the argument that this omission precludes a burglary offense from fitting categorically within the residual clause is foreclosed in by our decision in\n  <em>\n   United States v.

He also contends that, because \u201ca lawful entry into a building poses a lesser risk than forced entry,\u201d the Arizona statute\u2019s lack of a requirement of criminal intent formed prior to entry means that Arizona burglary \u201cdoes not necessarily involve violent, aggressive behavior.\u201d\n <\/p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">\n  There are two problems with Terrell\u2019s argument. First, it conflicts with\n  <em>\n   James\n  <\/em>\n  and\n  <em>\n   Mayer.\n  <\/em>\n  In\n  <em>\n   Mayer,\n  <\/em>\n  we held that Oregon\u2019s first-degree burglary statute satisfied the\n  <em>\n   Begay\n  <\/em>\n  test despite its inclusion of movable \u201cbuildings,\u201d reasoning that a burglar\u2019s entry into movable buildings \u201ctypically involves, much like generic burglary, ... \u2018purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u2019 \u201d\n  <em>\n   Mayer,\n  <\/em>\n  560 F.3d at 962 (quoting\n  <em>\n   Begay,\n  <\/em>\n  128 S.Ct. at 1586).

Given our determinations thus far, Terrell\u2019s\n  <em>\n   Begay\n  <\/em>\n  argument would result in the following three-step analysis: (1) Terrell\u2019s burglary offenses do not fit categorically within the enumerated offenses; (2) Terrell\u2019s burglary offenses fit categorically within subsection (ii)\u2019s residual clause\u2014that is, in the ordinary case, burglary presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another; (3) under\n  <em>\n   Begay,\n  <\/em>\n  Terrell\u2019s burglary offenses are not \u201croughly similar\u201d to generic burglary because they cover a broader range of conduct than the enumerated burglary offense.

Terrell was convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court enhanced Terrell's sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921-31, which raises the mandatory minimum sentence for convicted felons in possession of a firearm who have \"three previous convictions ... for a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Terrell argues that the prior convictions relied upon for the enhancement\u0097sexual assault under Arizona law, second-degree burglary under Arizona law, and second-degree burglary under Missouri law\u0097do not qualify as \"violent felon[ies]\" under the ACCA. We hold that all of these prior offenses fit categorically within the ACCA's residual clause in that they \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, we affirm the district court's decision to enhance Terrell's sentence.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>I<\/h2>\n<p>On May 31, 2005, as part of a large-scale operation to identify drug and firearm dealers, Phoenix Police Detective Matthew Shay met with Terrell, claiming that he wanted to purchase firearms. After several subsequent discussions and meetings with Terrell and with Terrell's co-defendant, Cindy O'Quinn, Shay purchased a.380 caliber pistol from Terrell.<\/p>\n<p>On September 20, 2006, Terrell was charged in the District of Arizona with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The indictment also alleged that, at the time of the offense, Terrell had previously been convicted of at least three felony offenses: (1) Burglary in the Second Degree on or about November 23, 1988, in Maricopa County, Arizona; (2) Sexual Assault on or about September 8, 1992, in Maricopa County, Arizona; and (3) Burglary in the Second Degree on or about March 3, 1993, in St. Louis County, Missouri.

The PSR then found that Terrell's offense level of thirty-three and criminal history category of VI resulted in a Sentencing Guidelines range of 235 to 293 months.<\/p>\n<p>Terrell objected to the PSR, arguing that the alleged prior felony convictions were not \"violent felon[ies]\" and therefore that Terrell was not subject to an enhanced sentence under the ACCA. The district court overruled Terrell's objections to the PSR and held that Terrell's prior convictions qualified him as an armed career criminal under the ACCA. The court stated:<\/p>\n<blockquote>I think ... the whole approach to the categorization of prior offenses as crimes of violence ... is really needlessly complex.... And the case law that has developed ... contributes, I think, to the wholesale confusion in this area.... We, I think, intuitively know what Congress is trying to do, and yet given all the gloss and all the complexity, its intent is sometimes frustrated.... [I]t strikes me that at the end of the day, whether [Terrell's prior offenses] fit nicely within the categorical approach or the modified categorical approach, that, at a minimum, they fit within the residual clause of [the ACCA] as violent felonies.<\/blockquote>\n<p>However, the court granted the government's motion for a downward departure of two levels for substantial assistance and sentenced Terrell at the low end of the post-departure Guidelines range: 188 months' imprisonment, followed by a five-year term of supervised release.

We first review the complex statutory and legal framework governing this case.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1088<\/span> Terrell was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), which prohibits previously convicted felons from possessing firearms. In the ordinary case, the maximum penalty for violating \u00a7 922(g) is a fine and imprisonment for up to ten years. <i>See<\/i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, a defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) who \"has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony\" is subject to a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence. <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 924(e)(1).

Thus, for each of Terrell's prior convictions, we must apply the categorical and, if appropriate, modified categorical approach to determine whether the state offense fits within one of two portions of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (\"subsection (ii)\"). <i>See <\/i><i>Taylor v.

Ed. 2d<\/span> <span class=\"page\">490<\/span> <\/a><\/span>(2008). In <i>Begay,<\/i> the Supreme Court determined that subsection (ii)'s enumerated offenses\u0097burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives\u0097\"indicate[ ] that the statute covers only <i>similar<\/i> crimes, rather than <i>every<\/i> crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 1585 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Thus, even if Terrell's offenses \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), we must determine whether these crimes are \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses\u0097that is, whether they \"typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>III<\/h2>\n<p>We now address, in turn, whether Terrell's sexual assault and burglary convictions fit within the ACCA's \"violent felony\" definition.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1089<\/span> A<\/h2>\n<p>Arizona law provides that \"[a] person commits sexual assault by intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact with any person <i>without consent<\/i> of such person.\" ARIZ. REV. STAT. \u00a7 13-1406(A) (emphasis added). The statute defines \"without consent\" to include circumstances in which \"[t]he victim is coerced by the immediate use or threatened use of force against a person or property.\" <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(a). However, it also includes circumstances in which no force or threat of force is used, including where \"[t]he victim is incapable of consent\" because of mental disorder, drugs, or other similar impairments known to the defendant, <i>id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(b); where \"[t]he victim is intentionally deceived as to the nature of the act,\" <i>id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(c); or where \"[t]he victim is intentionally deceived to erroneously believe that the person is the victim's spouse,\" <i>id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(d).<\/p>\n<p>Sexual assault is not one of the enumerated offenses in subsection (ii). Thus, we must decide whether Terrell's sexual assault offense fits within the residual clause. This determination requires us to determine: (1) whether the offense \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); and (2) whether sexual assault under Arizona law is \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that it \"typically involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>1<\/h2>\n<p>Regarding the categorical approach, Terrell argues that, because the Arizona sexual assault statute does not require force or coercion, but rather a person can be convicted of sexual assault even if the victim permits the intercourse, his prior sexual assault offense does not fit categorically within the residual clause. This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <i>United States v. Riley,<\/i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765210\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/765210\/united-states-v-henry-nash-riley\/\"><span class=\"volume\">183<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d<\/span> <span class=\"page\">1155<\/span> <\/a><\/span>(9th Cir.1999).<\/p>\n<p>In <i>Riley,<\/i> we held that a conviction for \"attempted simple rape\" under Louisiana law qualified categorically as a \"crime of violence\" in that it involved conduct that presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <i>Id.<\/i> at 1159. Like the Arizona sexual assault statute, the Louisiana simple rape statute included circumstances in which no coercion or force was used, such as when the victim did not understand the nature of the act by reason of drugs or \"unsoundness of mind,\" or when the victim submitted to the intercourse based on the belief that the defendant was her husband. <i>See id.<\/i> at 1158. We reasoned that the personal contact inherently involved in simple rape \"coupled with the nature of this offense creates an atmosphere that fosters the potential for physical confrontation,\" so that \"[e]ven in its least violent form, simple rape ... could result in physical injury to the victim.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 1159.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense, Terrell's case is indistinguishable from <i>Riley,<\/i> and thus he argues only that <i>Riley<\/i> is no longer good law in light of <i>Begay.<\/i> It is true that <i>Riley<\/i> (which was decided before <i>Begay<\/i>) did not consider whether the Louisiana simple rape offense was \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses, and thus left open the question whether the Arizona sexual assault statute satisfies the <i>Begay<\/i> analysis. However, <i>Begay<\/i> does not affect the <i>Riley<\/i> court's determination that simple rape (a similar offense to sexual assault under Arizona law) involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another even if it can be committed with the permission of the victim. Whether the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1090<\/span> Arizona statute satisfies <i>Begay<\/i>'s \"roughly similar\" test is an issue separate from the issue whether the statute involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <i>See <\/i><i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585 (stating that the presence of the enumerated offenses \"indicates that the statute covers only <i>similar<\/i> crimes, rather than <i>every<\/i> crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We turn now to the <i>Begay<\/i> analysis.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>2<\/h2>\n<p>We have not decided the issue framed by <i>Begay:<\/i> whether sexual assault \"typically involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 1586 (internal quotation marks omitted). Terrell argues that sexual assault under Arizona law does not satisfy this test because a defendant can be convicted under the Arizona statute even if the intercourse occurs with the victim's permission, such as when the defendant deceives the victim into thinking that the defendant is the victim's spouse. He relies primarily on our decision in <i>United States v. Christensen,<\/i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1389482\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/1389482\/united-states-v-christensen\/\"><span class=\"volume\">559<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d<\/span> <span class=\"page\">1092<\/span> <\/a><\/span>(9th Cir.2009).<\/p>\n<p>In <i>Christensen,<\/i> we held that the defendant's conviction for <i>statutory<\/i> rape under Washington law did not constitute a \"violent felony\" under <i>Begay. <\/i><i>Christensen,<\/i> 559 F.3d at 1095. Under Washington law, a person could be guilty of statutory rape simply by having sexual intercourse with a person of a certain age, regardless of whether the victim consented to the intercourse. <i>See id.<\/i> at 1093. We first noted that, \"[b]ecause the Court in <i>Begay<\/i> used the conjunction `and,' all three of its criteria\u0097'purposeful, violent, and aggressive'\u0097 must be satisfied.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 1095. We then held that, \"because statutory rape may involve consensual sexual intercourse, it does not necessarily involve either `violent' or `aggressive' conduct.\" <i>Id.<\/i> (citation omitted).<\/p>\n<p>Terrell's case is distinguishable from <i>Christensen<\/i> in three crucial ways. First, whereas the \"typical\" case of statutory rape does not involve violent and aggressive conduct, the \"typical\" case of ordinary sexual assault does indeed involve violent and aggressive conduct. Pure <i>statutory<\/i> rape laws like the law in <i>Christensen<\/i> are generally designed to target precisely the kind of situation that does <i>not<\/i> involve violent or aggressive conduct. Their purpose is instead to target defendants whose sexual partners are, by law, considered too young to give lawful consent.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, simple rape is \"a <i>violent<\/i> crime because it <i>normally involves force,<\/i> or the threat of force or intimidation, to overcome the will and the capacity of the victim to resist. Rape is <i>very often<\/i> accompanied by physical injury to the female and can also inflict mental and psychological damage.\" <i>Coker v. Georgia,<\/i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109731\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/109731\/coker-v-georgia\/\"><span class=\"volume\">433<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.<\/span> <span class=\"page\">584<\/span><\/a><\/span>, 597-98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109731\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/109731\/coker-v-georgia\/\"><span class=\"volume\">97<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d<\/span> <span class=\"page\">982<\/span> <\/a><\/span>(1977) (emphases added). It is true that some sexual assault statutes, like the Arizona statute, have been drawn in such a way as to sweep in <i>some<\/i> cases that do not necessarily involve violence or aggression, such as when the defendant deceives the victim. However, this extra coverage does not change the fact that the \"typical\" case of sexual assault does involve violent and aggressive actions by the defendant. <i>See id.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Second, even in those cases where the rape is \"achieved by trickery or deception,\" that fact \"does not erase the everpresent possibility that the victim may figure out what's really going on and decide to resist, in turn requiring the perpetrator to resort to actual physical restraint\" that could then \"easily escalate into a <i>violent<\/i> confrontation.\" <i>Riley,<\/i> 183 F.3d at 1159 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1091<\/span> added). In this sense, the ordinary case of sexual assault involves at least as much violence and aggression as the ordinary case of burglary. Generic burglary, after all, is often accomplished in cases where no one other than the defendant is present in the structure being burglarized, and thus a violent confrontation will occur only if someone arrives and discovers the defendant. In contrast, \"[p]ersonal contact is, of course, part and parcel of simple rape,\" <i>id.<\/i> at 1158, making the potential for face-to-face physical confrontation more likely in \"deceptive\" sexual assault cases than in the ordinary case of burglary.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the typical case of statutory rape does not involve this same risk of violent escalation. Ordinarily, there is nothing that the victim is likely to \"figure out,\" <i>id.<\/i> at 1159, during the sexual activity that would cause the situation to escalate into violence. Thus, sexual assault under Arizona law is very different from the statute in <i>Christensen<\/i> despite the fact that both statutes punish certain kinds of sexual activity.<\/p>\n<p>Third, the <i>Christensen<\/i> court relied explicitly on the fact that \"statutory rape may involve <i>consensual<\/i> sexual intercourse\" in finding that it did \"not necessarily involve either `violent' or `aggressive' <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1389482\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">conduct.\"<\/span> <a href=\"\/opinion\/1389482\/united-states-v-christensen\/\"><span class=\"volume\">559<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d<\/span> at <span class=\"page\">1095<\/span> <\/a><\/span>(emphasis added). The Arizona sexual assault statute explicitly requires that the defendant engage in sexual activity \"<i>without consent<\/i>\" of the victim. ARIZ. REV. STAT. \u00a7 13-1406(A) (emphasis added). Although Arizona law defines \"without consent\" to include certain circumstances where no force or coercion is used, <i>see id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1401(5)(b)-(d), a lack of consent on the part of the victim is an express element of Arizona sexual assault, which was not the case in <i>Christensen.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\"Short of homicide, [rape] is the ultimate violation of self,\" <i>Coker,<\/i> 433 U.S. at 597, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109731\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/109731\/coker-v-georgia\/\"><span class=\"volume\">97<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, we hold that Terrell's prior sexual assault conviction qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA's residual clause because it \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and is \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that it typically \"involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1586.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>B<\/h2>\n<p>We turn now to Terrell's burglary convictions. Terrell was convicted of second-degree burglary under both Arizona and Missouri law. Arizona law provides that \"[a] person commits burglary in the second degree by entering or remaining unlawfully in or on a <i>residential structure<\/i> with the intent to commit any theft or any felony therein.\" ARIZ. REV. STAT. \u00a7 13-1507(A) (emphasis added). Importantly, a separate provision defines the term \"residential structure\" to mean \"any structure, <i>movable<\/i> or immovable, permanent or temporary, that is adapted for both human residence and lodging whether occupied or not.\" <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1501(11) (emphasis added). Finally, the statute defines \"structure\" to include \"any vending machine or any building, object, vehicle, railroad car or place with sides and a floor that is separately securable from any other structure attached to it.\" <i>Id.<\/i> \u00a7 13-1501(12).<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Missouri law provides that \"[a] person commits the crime of burglary in the second degree when he knowingly enters unlawfully or knowingly remains unlawfully in a <i>building or inhabitable structure<\/i> for the purpose of committing a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1092<\/span> crime therein.\" MO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 569.170(1) (emphasis added). Missouri Revised Statute section 569.010(2), in turn, also includes movable objects in the burglary definition, providing that the term \"inhabitable structure\" includes \"a ship, trailer, sleeping car, airplane, or other vehicle or structure\" where people live, conduct business, assemble, or stay overnight.<\/p>\n<p>We now address, in turn, whether these state burglary offenses fit within either the enumerated offenses or residual clause of subsection (ii) of the ACCA's \"violent felony\" definition. We hold that, although Terrell's prior burglary offenses do not fit within the enumerated offenses, they do fit within the residual clause.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>1<\/h2>\n<p>Burglary is one of the enumerated offenses in subsection (ii) of the ACCA. <i>See<\/i> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). In determining whether Terrell's prior burglary offenses fit within the burglary offense enumerated in the ACCA, we must apply the categorical and modified categorical approaches to compare Terrell's prior burglary offenses to the \"generic\" definition of burglary set forth in <i>Taylor,<\/i> which contains three elements: \"[1] unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, [2] a building or structure, [3] with intent to commit a <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">crime.\"<\/span> <a href=\"\/opinion\/112435\/taylor-v-united-states\/\"><span class=\"volume\">495<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.<\/span> at <span class=\"page\">599<\/span><\/a><\/span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/112435\/taylor-v-united-states\/\"><span class=\"volume\">110<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And regarding the Arizona statute in particular, Terrell argues that, because the statute \"lacks the element of criminal intent formed prior to entry, it does not embody the same risks as the generic burglary.\"<\/p>\n<p>Neither of these arguments is persuasive, because the Supreme Court and this court have consistently held that burglary involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, even in cases where the relevant state statutes were missing the same elements of generic burglary that are missing from the Arizona and Missouri burglary statutes in this case. In <i>James,<\/i> the Supreme Court held that Florida's attempted burglary offense fit within subsection (ii)'s residual clause even though the offense did not even require <i>entry<\/i> into a structure, let alone the \"unlawful\" entry required by <i>Taylor.

Similarly, the lack of a requirement of unlawful intent prior to entry in Arizona <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1094<\/span> burglary law does not change the fact that committing the offense, \"in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 208, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145743\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/145743\/james-v-united-states\/\"><span class=\"volume\">127<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d<\/span> <span class=\"page\">100<\/span> <\/span>(2009). In <i>Mayer,<\/i> we held that first-degree burglary in Oregon was categorically a violent felony under the residual clause even though Oregon's definition of \"building\" included vehicles, aircrafts, and other movable structures, and was thus broader than <i>Taylor<\/i>'s generic definition. <i>See id.<\/i> at 954, 959. We relied on <i>James<\/i> to find that \"[t]he risk of potential injury due to a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party is not lessened simply because, under Oregon law, the dwelling does not have to be a generic `building' or `structure.'\" <i>Id.<\/i> at 963. Similarly, committing burglary under Arizona or Missouri law presents a serious potential risk of physical injury despite the statutes' broad definitions of \"structure.\" <i>See <\/i><i>United States v. Cantrell,<\/i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189752\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/1189752\/united-states-v-cantrell\/\"><span class=\"volume\">530<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d<\/span> <span class=\"page\">684<\/span><\/a><\/span>, 695-96 (8th Cir.2008) (holding that Missouri's second-degree burglary offense was categorically a \"crime of violence\" under the residual clause of the Guidelines' definition despite its broad definition of \"inhabitable structure,\" because of \"the risk of a violent confrontation between [the defendant] and the occupant, the police, or another third party\").<\/p>\n<p>Having decided that Terrell's burglary offenses fit categorically within subsection (ii)'s residual clause, we must determine whether these offenses are \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that they \"typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have little difficulty concluding that they are. Simply put, it is hard to imagine that a state's \"burglary\" definition would not be at least \"roughly similar\" to generic \"burglary.\" Terrell argues, however, that \"it is not enough to look at the label of the offense.\" He argues that, because the state burglary definitions include movable structures, the crimes of which Terrell was convicted are not \"similar, in kind as well as in degree of risks posed, to the examples themselves.\" <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585. He also contends that, because \"a lawful entry into a building poses a lesser risk than forced entry,\" the Arizona statute's lack of a requirement of criminal intent formed prior to entry means that Arizona burglary \"does not necessarily involve violent, aggressive behavior.\"<\/p>\n<p>There are two problems with Terrell's argument. First, it conflicts with <i>James<\/i> and <i>Mayer.<\/i> In <i>Mayer,<\/i> we held that Oregon's first-degree burglary statute satisfied the <i>Begay<\/i> test despite its inclusion of movable \"buildings,\" reasoning that a burglar's entry into movable buildings \"typically involves, much like generic burglary,... `purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.'\" <i>Mayer,<\/i> 560 F.3d at 962 (quoting <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1586). And with respect to the Arizona statute's lack of a requirement of criminal intent formed prior to entry, <i>James<\/i> (although decided before <i>Begay<\/i>) conducted a similar analysis to the <i>Begay<\/i> test in finding that \"the risk posed by attempted burglary is <i>comparable<\/i> to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses\u0097here, completed burglary.\" <i>James,<\/i> 550 U.S. at 203, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145743\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/145743\/james-v-united-states\/\"><span class=\"volume\">127<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.<\/span> <span class=\"page\">1586<\/span> <\/a><\/span>(emphasis added). The Court found that, even though Florida's attempted burglary offense did not require <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1095<\/span> any entry into a structure, it posed the same kinds of risks as generic burglary because of the dangerous \"possibility of a face-to-face confrontation\" with a third party involved in any burglary. <i>Id.<\/i> Given that the Arizona law does not require \"unlawful entry\" but still requires \"entry,\" making it even more like generic burglary than the statute in <i>James,<\/i> we reject Terrell's argument that the Arizona statute is not \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary.<\/p>\n<p>The second problem with Terrell's argument is that it essentially converts the <i>Begay<\/i> analysis into a restatement of the question whether the offense of conviction fits categorically within subsection (ii)'s enumerated offenses. Given our determinations thus far, Terrell's <i>Begay<\/i> argument would result in the following three-step analysis: (1) Terrell's burglary offenses do not fit categorically within the enumerated offenses; (2) Terrell's burglary offenses fit categorically within subsection (ii)'s residual clause\u0097that is, in the ordinary case, burglary presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another; (3) under <i>Begay,<\/i> Terrell's burglary offenses are not \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary because they cover a broader range of conduct than the enumerated burglary offense. Under this logic, the <i>Begay<\/i> analysis (step 3) is not meaningfully different from the determination of whether the burglary convictions fit categorically within the enumerated offenses (step 1), a result that renders the residual clause (and step 2) meaningless. The more plausible interpretation of <i>Begay<\/i> is that a state burglary offense is almost always at least \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary even if the state offense is somewhat broader.<sup>[4]<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Thus, we hold that Terrell's Arizona and Missouri burglary convictions qualify as \"violent felon[ies]\" under the residual clause because they \"involve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and are \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary, <i>Begay,<\/i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>IV<\/h2>\n<p>Because the district court correctly held that Terrell had been convicted of at least three \"violent felon[ies]\" at the time he committed his felon in possession offense, we affirm the district court's decision to enhance Terrell's sentence under the ACCA.<\/p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.<\/p>\n<h2>NOTES<\/h2>\n<p>[1]  The definition of \"violent felony\" under the ACCA is nearly identical to the definition of \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Guidelines, so we have interpreted these provisions in a \"parallel manner.\" <i>United States v.

In order to avoid confusion, we will discuss Terrell's convictions in terms of the ACCA, but the analysis applies equally to \u00a7 4B1.2.<\/p>\n<p>[2]  Terrell also argues that the enhancement of his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment because the prosecution did not prove his prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

Curran State Representative 210 West Main Street Clarksville, Arkansas 72830-3019<\/p>\n<p>Dear Representative Curran:<\/p>\n<p>This is in response to your request for an opinion on whether any of the following agencies can perform a background check for purchasers of handguns: 1) The county sheriff; 2) the municipal chief of police; or 3) an equivalent officer or the designee of any such individual. You note that 27 CFR Part 178 (the rules and regulations implementing the \"Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act\") provide that any of the above officials are authorized to conduct the background checks. It is your understanding, however, that the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms will \"cite\" any gun dealer requesting a background check from any law enforcement agency other than the Arkansas State Police.<\/p>\n<p>It is my opinion that in Arkansas the background checks may only be conducted by the Arkansas State Police.<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>The regulations to which you refer were adopted effective February 28, 1994, and amended the pertinent sections of 27 CFR Part 178. See <cross_reference>59 Federal Register 7110<\/cross_reference>-01. The relevant portion of the rule amends 27 CFR by adding a new section, 178.102, which provides at subsection (a)(4) thereof as follows:<\/p>\n<p>The law requires that notice of the contents of the transferees statement of intent to obtain a handgun and the statement be provided by the licensee to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee. Under the law, the chief law enforcement officer means `the chief of police, the sheriff, or an equivalent officer or the designee of any such individual. Where the State or local law enforcement officials have notified the licensee that a particular official has been designated to receive the notice and statement specified in paragraphs (a)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section, the licensee shall provide the information to that designated official. [Emphasis added.]<\/p>\n<p>It is my understanding that the Arkansas State Police, in conjunction with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the Boards of both the Arkansas Sheriffs Association and the Arkansas Association of Chiefs of Police, with the advice and involvement of this office, agreed that the agency which would conduct the background checks would be the Arkansas State Police. This decision was based primarily on the practical ability of the Arkansas State Police to conduct such searches, and the relative impossibility of local law enforcement officials having access to complete enough information to conduct a thorough search. It appears that the federal regulations contemplate and acknowledge such designations, and require the licensees, in such a case, to forward the appropriate documents to the designated official.<\/p>\n<p>It is therefore my opinion that in Arkansas, the only law enforcement agency authorized to conduct \"background checks\" under the Brady Law is the Arkansas State Police.<\/p>\n<p>The foregoing opinion, which I hereby approve, was prepared by Deputy Attorney General Elana C.

Under the circumstances, however, we cannot conceive how the proposition of the Water Users' Association to increase its water supply by the building of the Mormon Flat dam could in any way mitigate any damages that plaintiffs might have sustained.<\/p>\n<p>The instruction as to the character of proof, to prove fraud when it is in issue, is clearly wrong. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 144<\/span> \nBecause the presumption is indulged that people are honest and usually act fairly and honestly with their fellows, one charging fraudulent and dishonest conduct and representations is required by one line of cases, in order to succeed in his charge, to produce clear and convincing proof thereof. 27 C.J. 81, &#167; 225, note 55. Another line of cases refuses to approve an instruction so strong, holding it places too great a burden on the plaintiff. 27 C.J. 81, &#167; 225, note 55.

The defendant convention filed an answer, alleging its possession and ownership of the property under a deed from the plaintiff, which was alleged to have been lost, and, by way of cross-complaint, the defendant prayed that its lost deed be restored and held valid, and that its title be quieted against the plaintiffs. In an answer to the cross-complaint the plaintiffs denied the execution of the deed or their power to execute it.<\/p>\n<p>From the testimony offered at the trial from which this appeal comes, it appears that seventy ladies, residents of Pine Bluff, were incorporated by order of the Jefferson Circuit Court, July 6, 1895, as the Hospital \nBenevolent Association, for the purpose of raising funds to establish and maintain a hospital in the city of Pine Bluff. Funds for this purpose were to be raised by annual dues to be collected from each member of the association, amounting to $1 a year, and by donations, legacies and subscriptions from charitably disposed persons.<\/p>\n<p>The constitution of the association provided for an annual meeting on the first Friday of October in each year, at which time a president, three vice presidents, a secretary and a treasurer should be elected, who should hold office for one year and until their successors were elected and qualified. It was provided in the constitution that ten members should constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Mrs. J. W. Crawford was elected president, Mrs. O. J. Taylor was secretary, and Dr. Lillian <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 948<\/span> \nG. Higginbotham assistant secretary, and the organization began to function by erecting and operating a hospital. To raise necessary funds, a mortgage of $4,000 was placed on the property; and other indebtedness was incurred. The enterprise was not a success, and the hospital was finally closed, and, after it had been closed for four or five months, its managing officers and friends began to cast about to devise means whereby it might be reopened and operated. Overtures were made to the convention to take over the hospital, and at a regular meeting of the hospital association on October 7, 1919, an amendment to the charter was adopted authorizing a lease of the property for ninety-nine years. A proposition was submitted to the hospital committee of the convention to lease the property, but this offer was declined, and a counter proposition was made to take over the property, repair it, pay the outstanding indebtedness, enlarge the hospital, and operate it, provided a deed was made to the convention.<\/p>\n<p>A called meeting of the plaintiff hospital association was held on October 10, 1919, to consider this counter-proposition, at which seventeen members of the association and two non-member friends were present. At this meeting the following resolution was unanimously adopted:<\/p>\n<p>\"Whereas, the Davis Hospital has been closed for several months for lack of sufficient funds to repair, reopen and run it; and whereas, the Baptists have undertaken to raise large sums for hospital purposes, and the Arkansas Baptist State Convention has offered to take a deed to the property and in consideration thereof agreed to maintain and run the hospital and from time to time enlarge it, as the demands for enlargement come and the necessities require, in the judgment of the board of said convention; and whereas, they have agreed to keep the name, Davis Hospital, for the institution perpetually, and to accept a deed requiring such perpetuation of the name and containing a stipulation that, if they fail <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 949<\/span> \nto perpetuate the name, or if they or their assigns or successors should fail to keep the property in reasonably good repair, or should fail or cease to maintain and run the institution as a hospital, then in any such event the title to the property shall at once revert to the grantor; now therefore be it by the Davis Hospital Benevolent Association in meeting assembled, resolved, that the president and secretary, or assistant secretary, of this association be, and they are, hereby authorized and empowered to make a deed to said Arkansas Baptist State Convention, or to such trustee as they may name, conveying to it or them the following described land, lying in Jefferson County, State of Arkansas, to-wit: Lots one and two, in block seventy-six, in Tannehill  Owens' addition to the city of Pine Bluff, for the consideration and purposes and containing the stipulations required by the foregoing preamble; and, for the same consideration and purposes, to include in said deed the furniture and hospital appliances on said land. Only the land and building and the furniture and appliances shall be conveyed. The Davis Hospital Benevolent Association shall reserve to itself such funds, devises and legacies as it now owns, and such devises and legacies as are provided for in wills already made to it or Davis Hospital.\"<\/p>\n<p>Pursuant to this resolution, a deed was prepared from the hospital association to the convention, which was duly acknowledged by the president and the assistant secretary of the association. This deed was delivered to a member of the hospital committee of the convention, but was lost without having been recorded.<\/p>\n<p>The cause was tried in the court below, by consent, without a jury, and the court found the fact to be that this deed was executed and delivered and that the title to the property there described passed to the convention, and judgment was rendered accordingly, and from that judgment is this appeal.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff association &#8212; the appellant here &#8212; states in its brief that \"the only issue before the court for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 950<\/span> \ndetermination is whether the deed claimed by defendant to have been made was in fact made, and, if so, whether it was legally made so as to be a valid deed.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"The rule is well established in this State, as well as by the authorities generally, that the burden is upon one who claims title under the alleged lost instrument to establish the execution, contents, and loss of such instrument by the clearest, most conclusive, and satisfactory proof.\" Erwin v. Kerrin, <cross_reference>169 Ark. 183<\/cross_reference>, <cross_reference>274 S.W. 2<\/cross_reference>, and cases there cited.<\/p>\n<p>The first question for decision is therefore whether the proof tending to establish the alleged lost deed from the hospital association to the convention meets this test.<\/p>\n<p>We think it does, and the court below so found. By collaboration of the persons interested in the preparation, execution, and examination of the lost deed it has been restored, and these persons testified that the restored deed is substantially identical with the lost deed. Among the witnesses who testified as to the execution and contents of the lost deed was J. W. Crawford, an attorney at Pine Bluff, whose wife was the president of the hospital association. He testified that his wife had devoted much of her time to the work of the hospital association, and was much concerned about reopening the hospital. He prepared the lost deed, and in a general way remembered its recitals, although he had not kept a copy of it, and testified that the restored deed was substantially identical with the one he had prepared. After the deed had been executed and acknowledged, he transmitted it to a member of the hospital committee of the convention. He had also prepared the resolution for adoption by the hospital association authorizing the sale of the property to the convention. He had kept a copy of this resolution, and identified the resolution set out above appearing in the restored deed as identical with the one which he had prepared for adoption by the association at the called meeting held on October 10, 1919. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 951<\/span> <\/p>\n<p>H. T. Allcott testified that he was a notary public, and that, as such, he had taken the acknowledgments of the president and the assistant secretary of the hospital association to the deed. He stated in detail the circumstances under which the acknowledgments had been taken.<\/p>\n<p>After the execution and delivery of the deed to the hospital committee of the convention it was submitted for examination and approval to Judge W. R. Donham of Little Rock, a practicing attorney and a member of the hospital committee. Judge Donham testified that he made a careful examination of the deed to determine its sufficiency, and in connection with this examination made copious notes as to its recitals. These notes he had preserved, but the deed itself was lost, and he was unable to find it, after a most exhaustive search. He had not surrendered the possession of the deed to any one, and when he last saw the deed it was in his possession. He testified that the restored deed is substantially identical with the one given him for examination.<\/p>\n<p>The deed was executed to R. Carnahan, H. C. Fox and J. P. Runyan, as trustees, for the use and benefit of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. Mr. Carnahan was a resident of Pine Bluff, and was one of the visitors who attended the meeting of the hospital association of October 10, and was instrumental in inducing the convention to take over the hospital. He also testified as to the execution of the deed, and it was he who delivered it to the hospital committee of the convention.<\/p>\n<p>The hospital property was accurately described in the deed which `conveyed that property to the trustees named, on the conditions and limitations set out in the resolution of the hospital association adopted on October 10, and which was incorporated in the deed.<\/p>\n<p>Several members of the hospital association testified that they were not advised of the meeting held on October 10, and knew nothing of the action taken at that meeting in regard to the sale of the property. They were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 952<\/span> \nadvised of the meeting held on October 7, at which time a resolution was adopted which authorized a lease of the property for ninety-nine years, and, while they knew the property had been taken over and was being operated by the convention, they supposed this was done under the authority of the resolution adopted October 7.<\/p>\n<p>The assistant secretary of the association, whose name was signed to the deed, denied having signed or executed it; but, without setting out the testimony in this respect, we announce our conclusion to be that this good lady had merely forgotten the incident. The high character of all the witnesses who have testified is such that the case presents no question of veracity of any of the witnesses. We are sure all testified truthfully, so far as they remembered the facts about which they testified; but while this is true, we are of opinion that the testimony measures up to the requirements announced in the case of Erwin v. Kerrin, supra, to prove the execution and delivery of the lost deed and the contents and sufficiency of that instrument.<\/p>\n<p>It is further insisted that, although the execution, contents and delivery of the deed have been sufficiently proved to establish it as a lost instrument, it was not valid as a conveyance, for the reason that it was an ultra vires act on the part of the officers of the association who executed the deed, and the case of Fordyce v. Woman's Christian National Library Assn., <cross_reference>79 Ark. 550<\/cross_reference>,<cross_reference>96 S.W. 155<\/cross_reference>, 7 L.R.A. (N.S.) 485, is cited in support of that contention. In that case it was held that the property of a charity cannot be sold under an execution on a judgment rendered for the nonfeasance, misfeasance or malfeasance of its agents trustees, for the reason that a charitable trust cannot be destroyed through the wrongful acts of the trustees, and it is insisted that the officers of the hospital association have, through the execution of the deed, wrongfully destroyed the trust committed to their management.<\/p>\n<p>We do not concur in this view. On the contrary, the purpose of the trust has not been destroyed. The undisputed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 953<\/span> \ntestimony shows that the hospital association had come to the end of its resources, and the trust was about to fail through lack of support. The hospital had been closed, and the property was deteriorating in value, and the debts of the association were unpaid. The deed to the convention required that body to maintain and run the hospital, and from time to time enlarge it as the necessity therefor required, and the conveyance was valid as such so long only as these conditions were complied with. That these conditions have been fully complied with will be later herein shown.<\/p>\n<p>We conclude therefore that the execution of the deed by the officers of the hospital association was not an act which was beyond the power of the corporation itself to authorize, as it tended to perpetuate and promote the purposes of that organization.<\/p>\n<p>It is insisted that the execution of this deed was authorized at a called meeting, which was not provided for in the constitution of the hospital association, and that the body of the members were not notified of the meeting, and that the execution of the deed was therefore unauthorized, and that the members of the association will not be held to have ratified this conveyance through the subsequent action of the convention, for the reason that the members of the hospital association had the right to assume that the possession and occupancy of the hospital by the convention was referable to the resolution adopted at the regular meeting on October 7 authorizing a lease of the property.<\/p>\n<p>We think, however, that it must be held that the hospital association has in fact ratified this deed, even though its execution was not authorized. More than a quorum of the members attended the meeting at which the resolution was adopted authorizing the sale of the property, and the transaction was a sale, and not a gift, as is contended by appellant. The deed was executed upon the consideration of the assumption of burdensome obligations by the convention. It is not intimated that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 954<\/span> \nmeeting of October 10 was surreptitiously called, and there is no reason to even suspect that the action then taken was concealed. All parties appear to have been actuated by the most laudable motives. The resolution then adopted directing the sale of the property was in a form which, if otherwise authorized, would have conferred the power to sell the property. There was nothing to indicate to the convention that it would not take by the deed tendered to it the title which that instrument purported to convey, and there is no reason to doubt that the members who did not attend the meeting of October 10 might, with but slight inquiry, have ascertained the terms and conditions upon which the convention took over the hospital.<\/p>\n<p>The undisputed testimony shows that after the delivery of the deed, the convention expended $20,000 to put the hospital in condition to be operated, and altogether expenditures aggregating $33,000 were made, including enlargement and equipment, and the institution has been raised to a grade A hospital, and is now being operated as such. In other words, the conditions upon which the deed was executed have been fully complied with, and have been since the date of that deed, which was October 31, 1919. This suit was not filed questioning the title of the convention to the property until June 15, 1925.<\/p>\n<p>The case of Merchants'  Farmers' Bank v. Harris Lbr. Co., <cross_reference>103 Ark. 283<\/cross_reference>, <cross_reference>146 S.W. 508<\/cross_reference>, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 713, was one in which the right of the secretary and treasurer of a corporation to execute a chattel mortgage upon the corporate property was questioned, and, in holding the stockholders had ratified that action, the court quoted with approval from 2 Morawetz on Private Corporations (2 ed.), 623, as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"In 2 Morawetz on Private Corporations (2 ed.), 623, it is said: `If the shareholders who constitute the corporate association unanimously acquiesce in or ratify an act performed by an agent or board on behalf of the corporation, no further question as to the extent of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 955<\/span> \npowers delegated to the agent or board can arise. Ratification by all the shareholders would not cure the illegality of an act which is prohibited by the common law or statute; but it would remove any defect of authority in an agent performing the act as between himself and the company. After such ratification, the company would become chargeable with the act to the same extent as if it had originally authorized it to be done'.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the same case it was there further said:<\/p>\n<p>\"All the shareholders of a corporation may waive the necessity for a meeting of its board of directors, and may, without such meeting, either authorize acts done by its agents within the scope of the powers of such corporation, or ratify those acts which have been done, and, by such authorization or ratification, bind the corporation itself. The rule that the members of the board of directors have the authority to act only when convened in a board meeting is for the benefit of the shareholders. The shareholders own the assets, and in fact constitute the corporation. All the shareholders may therefore waive the necessity for the meeting of all the members of the board of directors in the transaction of any business that is not beyond the powers of the corporation to enter into.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case of American Bonding Co. v. Laigle Stave Lbr. Co., <cross_reference>111 Ark. 151<\/cross_reference>, <cross_reference>163 S.W. 167<\/cross_reference>, the question was raised as to the power of an agent of a corporation to execute accommodation paper in the name of the corporation, and, after holding that such right was not within the real or apparent scope of the agent's authority, the court held that such action might be ratified. It was there said:<\/p>\n<p>\"In 2 Thompson on Corporations (2 ed.), 2019, the rule of acquiescence in or ratification of an unauthorized act of the officers or agents of a corporation is stated as follows: `Acquiescence for a considerable time by a corporation, through its efficient agencies and the body of its stockholders, in a state of facts, after knowledge or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 956<\/span> \nafter such a length of time and such a condition of circumstances that a knowledge is to be inferred, will operate as a ratification. * * * Ratification of this character may rest on the principle of equitable estoppel, on the theory that one man, though innocent, ought not to allow another innocent man to rest in the belief that a voidable engagement is valid until the latter has changed his position. It also rests on the moral consideration that the former, after allowing the hopes of the latter to be raised for a considerable length of time, in respect of whatever benefits may accrue or may have accrued from the engagement, ought not to be allowed to disappoint those hopes. The rule therefore is that, where the agents of a corporation exceed their powers, their principal must, as in the case of a natural person, disaffirm promptly, or at least within a reasonable time, having regard to the circumstances of each case'.\"<\/p>\n<p>The case of Common Sense Mining  Milling Co. v. Taylor, 152 S.W. 5, was one in which the president and secretary of the corporation had, without authority, sold the assets of the corporation, and their grantee, under the unauthorized conveyance, expended a large amount of money on the property conveyed. For a period of five months the stockholders remained inert, and, when finally they called the conveyance in question, the court held that, by their inaction, they had ratified the unauthorized act. In so holding, the Supreme Court of Missouri, through Graves, P. J., said:<\/p>\n<p>\"Judge Thompson, in 10 Cyc., p. 1065, says: `Subject to exceptions in case of municipal or governmental corporations, which are held to a strict exercise of their powers, the general rule is that corporations quite as much as individuals are held to a careful adherence to truth in their dealings with mankind, and cannot, by representations or by silence, involve others in onerous engagements and then defeat the just expectations which their conduct has superinduced. A round statement of this doctrine is that estoppels in pais operate against corporations. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 957<\/span> \nin like manner as against natural persons.' And further discussing the doctrine of estoppel as applicable to corporations, at page 1066 of the same volume, says: `As more fully explained later, the same principle validates the voidable acts of corporations, on the theory of a ratification by the acquiescence of all the shareholders, so that, after a long delay, in which time other rights have supervened or expectations have been founded, upon the faith of an existing state of facts, the shareholders will be precluded from maintaining actions in equity to undo what has been done by the directors or officers without their authority.' The same writer, in his work on Corporations (2 Thompson on Corporations, 2 ed., par. 1960, p. 1048), says: `In the law of agency there is a rule that, if one accepts the benefits of an unauthorized contract made in his behalf by another, he is bound by its terms the same as if he had entered into the contract in person or had expressly ratified it, provided, of course, that he had full knowledge of all the facts, and he is thereby estopped from repudiating the contract without restoring the benefits and putting the other party in statu quo. This principle is applicable, in its fullest sense, to corporations which, from their nature, can act only through the instrumentality of agents. If therefore an officer of a corporation, or other person, assuming to have power to bind the corporation, by a given contract enters into the contract for the corporation, and the corporation receives the fruits of the contract, and retains them after acquiring knowledge of the circumstances attending the making of the contract, it will thereby become estopped from afterwards rescinding or undoing the contract. In other words, by retaining the fruits of the unauthorized contract, with knowledge of the circumstances which entitle it to its election either to affirm or disaffirm it, the corporation ratifies the contract and makes it good by adoption.' In the same volume, at page 1056, it is further said: `it is not strictly necessary to the proper application of the principle <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 958<\/span> \nof estoppel that the corporation should have received a benefit from the contract, but it is sufficient that the other party has acted on the faith of it to his disadvantage, as where he has expended money on the faith of it. The reason of the rule is that honesty and fair dealing are the highest public policy, and that a private corporation, which is a mere collection of individuals, is no more privileged to repudiate its engagements and act dishonestly than a single individual is'.\"<\/p>\n<p>The court below expressly found the fact to be that the members of the hospital association, whose relation to that organization is not dissimilar to that of shareholders in the ordinary private corporation, had, by their inaction, ratified the sale of the property to the convention, and it is our opinion that the testimony sustains that finding.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below must therefore be affirmed, and it is so ordered.<\/p>","html_anon_2020":"nan","xml_harvard":"nan","html_with_citations":"<p>Appellant brought this suit in ejectment against the Arkansas Baptist State Convention, hereinafter referred to as the convention, to recover possession of a hospital and the adjacent grounds located in the city of Pine Bluff.

He stated in detail the circumstances under which the acknowledgments had been taken.<\/p>\n<p>After the execution and delivery of the deed to the hospital committee of the convention it was submitted for examination and approval to Judge W. R. Donham of Little Rock, a practicing attorney and a member of the hospital committee. Judge Donham testified that he made a careful examination of the deed to determine its sufficiency, and in connection with this examination made copious notes as to its recitals. These notes he had preserved, but the deed itself was lost, and he was unable to find it, after a most exhaustive search. He had not surrendered the possession of the deed to any one, and when he last saw the deed it was in his possession. He testified that the restored deed is substantially identical with the one given him for examination.<\/p>\n<p>The deed was executed to R. Carnahan, H. C. Fox and J. P. Runyan, as trustees, for the use and benefit of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. Mr. Carnahan was a resident of Pine Bluff, and was one of the visitors who attended the meeting of the hospital association of October 10, and was instrumental in inducing the convention to take over the hospital. He also testified as to the execution of the deed, and it was he who delivered it to the hospital committee of the convention.<\/p>\n<p>The hospital property was accurately described in the deed which `conveyed that property to the trustees named, on the conditions and limitations set out in the resolution of the hospital association adopted on October 10, and which was incorporated in the deed.<\/p>\n<p>Several members of the hospital association testified that they were not advised of the meeting held on October 10, and knew nothing of the action taken at that meeting in regard to the sale of the property. They were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 952<\/span> \nadvised of the meeting held on October 7, at which time a resolution was adopted which authorized a lease of the property for ninety-nine years, and, while they knew the property had been taken over and was being operated by the convention, they supposed this was done under the authority of the resolution adopted October 7.<\/p>\n<p>The assistant secretary of the association, whose name was signed to the deed, denied having signed or executed it; but, without setting out the testimony in this respect, we announce our conclusion to be that this good lady had merely forgotten the incident. The high character of all the witnesses who have testified is such that the case presents no question of veracity of any of the witnesses. We are sure all testified truthfully, so far as they remembered the facts about which they testified; but while this is true, we are of opinion that the testimony measures up to the requirements announced in the case of Erwin v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3276398\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/3273674\/erwin-v-kerrin\/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kerrin,<\/span> supra<\/a><\/span>, to prove the execution and delivery of the lost deed and the contents and sufficiency of that instrument.<\/p>\n<p>It is further insisted that, although the execution, contents and delivery of the deed have been sufficiently proved to establish it as a lost instrument, it was not valid as a conveyance, for the reason that it was an ultra vires act on the part of the officers of the association who executed the deed, and the case of Fordyce v. Woman's Christian National Library Assn., <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.<\/span> <span class=\"page\">550<\/span><\/span><\/cross_reference>,<cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">96<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.<\/span> <span class=\"page\">155<\/span><\/span><\/cross_reference>, 7 L.R.A. (N.S.) 485, is cited in support of that contention. In that case it was held that the property of a charity cannot be sold under an execution on a judgment rendered for the nonfeasance, misfeasance or malfeasance of its agents trustees, for the reason that a charitable trust cannot be destroyed through the wrongful acts of the trustees, and it is insisted that the officers of the hospital association have, through the execution of the deed, wrongfully destroyed the trust committed to their management.<\/p>\n<p>We do not concur in this view. On the contrary, the purpose of the trust has not been destroyed. The undisputed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 953<\/span> \ntestimony shows that the hospital association had come to the end of its resources, and the trust was about to fail through lack of support. The hospital had been closed, and the property was deteriorating in value, and the debts of the association were unpaid. The deed to the convention required that body to maintain and run the hospital, and from time to time enlarge it as the necessity therefor required, and the conveyance was valid as such so long only as these conditions were complied with. That these conditions have been fully complied with will be later herein shown.<\/p>\n<p>We conclude therefore that the execution of the deed by the officers of the hospital association was not an act which was beyond the power of the corporation itself to authorize, as it tended to perpetuate and promote the purposes of that organization.<\/p>\n<p>It is insisted that the execution of this deed was authorized at a called meeting, which was not provided for in the constitution of the hospital association, and that the body of the members were not notified of the meeting, and that the execution of the deed was therefore unauthorized, and that the members of the association will not be held to have ratified this conveyance through the subsequent action of the convention, for the reason that the members of the hospital association had the right to assume that the possession and occupancy of the hospital by the convention was referable to the resolution adopted at the regular meeting on October 7 authorizing a lease of the property.<\/p>\n<p>We think, however, that it must be held that the hospital association has in fact ratified this deed, even though its execution was not authorized. More than a quorum of the members attended the meeting at which the resolution was adopted authorizing the sale of the property, and the transaction was a sale, and not a gift, as is contended by appellant. The deed was executed upon the consideration of the assumption of burdensome obligations by the convention. It is not intimated that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 954<\/span> \nmeeting of October 10 was surreptitiously called, and there is no reason to even suspect that the action then taken was concealed. All parties appear to have been actuated by the most laudable motives. The resolution then adopted directing the sale of the property was in a form which, if otherwise authorized, would have conferred the power to sell the property. There was nothing to indicate to the convention that it would not take by the deed tendered to it the title which that instrument purported to convey, and there is no reason to doubt that the members who did not attend the meeting of October 10 might, with but slight inquiry, have ascertained the terms and conditions upon which the convention took over the hospital.<\/p>\n<p>The undisputed testimony shows that after the delivery of the deed, the convention expended $20,000 to put the hospital in condition to be operated, and altogether expenditures aggregating $33,000 were made, including enlargement and equipment, and the institution has been raised to a grade A hospital, and is now being operated as such. In other words, the conditions upon which the deed was executed have been fully complied with, and have been since the date of that deed, which was October 31, 1919. This suit was not filed questioning the title of the convention to the property until June 15, 1925.<\/p>\n<p>The case of Merchants'  Farmers' Bank v. Harris Lbr. Co., <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.<\/span> <span class=\"page\">283<\/span><\/span><\/cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.<\/span> <span class=\"page\">508<\/span><\/span><\/cross_reference>, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 713, was one in which the right of the secretary and treasurer of a corporation to execute a chattel mortgage upon the corporate property was questioned, and, in holding the stockholders had ratified that action, the court quoted with approval from 2 Morawetz on Private Corporations (2 ed.), 623, as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"In 2 Morawetz on Private Corporations (2 ed.), 623, it is said: `If the shareholders who constitute the corporate association unanimously acquiesce in or ratify an act performed by an agent or board on behalf of the corporation, no further question as to the extent of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 955<\/span> \npowers delegated to the agent or board can arise. Ratification by all the shareholders would not cure the illegality of an act which is prohibited by the common law or statute; but it would remove any defect of authority in an agent performing the act as between himself and the company. After such ratification, the company would become chargeable with the act to the same extent as if it had originally authorized it to be done'.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the same case it was there further said:<\/p>\n<p>\"All the shareholders of a corporation may waive the necessity for a meeting of its board of directors, and may, without such meeting, either authorize acts done by its agents within the scope of the powers of such corporation, or ratify those acts which have been done, and, by such authorization or ratification, bind the corporation itself. The rule that the members of the board of directors have the authority to act only when convened in a board meeting is for the benefit of the shareholders. The shareholders own the assets, and in fact constitute the corporation. All the shareholders may therefore waive the necessity for the meeting of all the members of the board of directors in the transaction of any business that is not beyond the powers of the corporation to enter into.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case of American Bonding Co. v. Laigle Stave Lbr. Co., <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.<\/span> <span class=\"page\">151<\/span><\/span><\/cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">163<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.<\/span> <span class=\"page\">167<\/span><\/span><\/cross_reference>, the question was raised as to the power of an agent of a corporation to execute accommodation paper in the name of the corporation, and, after holding that such right was not within the real or apparent scope of the agent's authority, the court held that such action might be ratified. It was there said:<\/p>\n<p>\"In 2 Thompson on Corporations (2 ed.), 2019, the rule of acquiescence in or ratification of an unauthorized act of the officers or agents of a corporation is stated as follows: `Acquiescence for a considerable time by a corporation, through its efficient agencies and the body of its stockholders, in a state of facts, after knowledge or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 956<\/span> \nafter such a length of time and such a condition of circumstances that a knowledge is to be inferred, will operate as a ratification. * * * Ratification of this character may rest on the principle of equitable estoppel, on the theory that one man, though innocent, ought not to allow another innocent man to rest in the belief that a voidable engagement is valid until the latter has changed his position. It also rests on the moral consideration that the former, after allowing the hopes of the latter to be raised for a considerable length of time, in respect of whatever benefits may accrue or may have accrued from the engagement, ought not to be allowed to disappoint those hopes. The rule therefore is that, where the agents of a corporation exceed their powers, their principal must, as in the case of a natural person, disaffirm promptly, or at least within a reasonable time, having regard to the circumstances of each case'.\"<\/p>\n<p>The case of Common Sense Mining  Milling Co. v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152<\/span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.<\/span> <span class=\"page\">5<\/span><\/span>, was one in which the president and secretary of the corporation had, without authority, sold the assets of the corporation, and their grantee, under the unauthorized conveyance, expended a large amount of money on the property conveyed. For a period of five months the stockholders remained inert, and, when finally they called the conveyance in question, the court held that, by their inaction, they had ratified the unauthorized act. In so holding, the Supreme Court of Missouri, through Graves, P. J., said:<\/p>\n<p>\"Judge Thompson, in 10 Cyc., p. 1065, says: `Subject to exceptions in case of municipal or governmental corporations, which are held to a strict exercise of their powers, the general rule is that corporations quite as much as individuals are held to a careful adherence to truth in their dealings with mankind, and cannot, by representations or by silence, involve others in onerous engagements and then defeat the just expectations which their conduct has superinduced. A round statement of this doctrine is that estoppels in pais operate against corporations. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 957<\/span> \nin like manner as against natural persons.' And further discussing the doctrine of estoppel as applicable to corporations, at page 1066 of the same volume, says: `As more fully explained later, the same principle validates the voidable acts of corporations, on the theory of a ratification by the acquiescence of all the shareholders, so that, after a long delay, in which time other rights have supervened or expectations have been founded, upon the faith of an existing state of facts, the shareholders will be precluded from maintaining actions in equity to undo what has been done by the directors or officers without their authority.' The same writer, in his work on Corporations (2 Thompson on Corporations, 2 ed., par. 1960, p. 1048), says: `In the law of agency there is a rule that, if one accepts the benefits of an unauthorized contract made in his behalf by another, he is bound by its terms the same as if he had entered into the contract in person or had expressly ratified it, provided, of course, that he had full knowledge of all the facts, and he is thereby estopped from repudiating the contract without restoring the benefits and putting the other party in statu quo. This principle is applicable, in its fullest sense, to corporations which, from their nature, can act only through the instrumentality of agents. If therefore an officer of a corporation, or other person, assuming to have power to bind the corporation, by a given contract enters into the contract for the corporation, and the corporation receives the fruits of the contract, and retains them after acquiring knowledge of the circumstances attending the making of the contract, it will thereby become estopped from afterwards rescinding or undoing the contract. In other words, by retaining the fruits of the unauthorized contract, with knowledge of the circumstances which entitle it to its election either to affirm or disaffirm it, the corporation ratifies the contract and makes it good by adoption.' In the same volume, at page 1056, it is further said: `it is not strictly necessary to the proper application of the principle <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 958<\/span> \nof estoppel that the corporation should have received a benefit from the contract, but it is sufficient that the other party has acted on the faith of it to his disadvantage, as where he has expended money on the faith of it. The reason of the rule is that honesty and fair dealing are the highest public policy, and that a private corporation, which is a mere collection of individuals, is no more privileged to repudiate its engagements and act dishonestly than a single individual is'.\"<\/p>\n<p>The court below expressly found the fact to be that the members of the hospital association, whose relation to that organization is not dissimilar to that of shareholders in the ordinary private corporation, had, by their inaction, ratified the sale of the property to the convention, and it is our opinion that the testimony sustains that finding.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below must therefore be affirmed, and it is so ordered.<\/p>","extracted_by_ocr":"f","author_id":"3775","cluster_id":"3266594"}

The question is whether certain income is attributable to petitioner for tax purposes. The returns were filed with the collector of internal revenue for the district of Florida. <\/p><p>Findings of Fact <\/p><p>Petitioner, a Florida corporation, was formed pursuant to an agreement between H. T. Broders and Horine Holding Company dated June 2, 1934. The agreement recites that Horine, as an unsatisfied creditor, had acquired interests in real estate known as Silver Bluff Estates, Inc., in Miami. Horine desired to liquidate its interests in this real estate and desired the services of Broders in this connection. Horine agreed to have formed a Florida corporation \"for the purpose of acquiring title, legal and\/or equitable, to all properties above referred to.\" Horine further bound itself \"to cause the necessary steps<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"2\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*171 <\/span> to be taken to have the legal title to all of the property referred to herein transferred to H. T. Broders and Morgan Van Valkenburgh as successor trustees for the use and benefit of the corporation to be formed.\" The agreement contemplated that Broders would be employed by the new corporation to \"rehabilitate, sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of the new corporation.\" <\/p><p>All moneys realized from the liquidation were to be distributed to Broders and Horine in proportions next described after the payment of operating expenses \"including funds necessary to the reimbursement to the party of the first part [Horine] for all monies advanced for the purpose of organizing the corporation referred to * * *\". After the payment of such expenses any amounts remaining in excess of $1,000 were to be paid 65 per cent to Horine, and 35 per cent to Broders. This ratio of distribution was to continue until Horine had received a total of $21,000, after which time Broders was to receive 50 per cent of the distributions. <\/p><p>It was agreed that 100 shares of no par common stock would be authorized and distributed, 49 shares to Horine, 1 share to Van Valkenburgh and 10 shares to Broders. The<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"3\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*172 <\/span> remaining 40 shares were to be placed in escrow to be subsequently delivered to Broders as next described. When Horine received in distributions from the proposed company the respective aggregate amounts of $5,250, $10,500, $15,750 and $21,000, Broders was to receive, respectively, an additional 10 shares from the escrow holder. In this manner, after Horine had received $21,000, Broders would have 50 shares of stock. The stock, while in escrow, could not be voted. <\/p><p>The agreement provided that the proposed company would have three directors, Broders, Van Valkenburg and a person selected by Horine. It was agreed that the directors would elect Broders president and manager, Van Valkenburg vice-president and treasurer, and the secretary to be named by Horine, and that these oficers would be reelected annually \"so long as the corporation may exist, and until said assets shall have been fully liquidated and distributed, as herein provided.\" <\/p><p>Petitioner was formed pursuant to the above described agreement and its by-laws included a copy of such agreement. The by-laws, in this connection, stated: <\/p><p>\"It being the intention of the incorporators of Silver Bluffs Estates, Inc., that the future<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"4\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*173 <\/span> management and affairs of this corporation be conducted in accordance with the intent of that certain Agreement * * * dated June 2 1934, and the said Agreement is herein set out and made a part of these by-laws.\" <\/p><p>The by-laws further provided that dividends \"shall be declared in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement dated June 2, 1934, * * *.\" <\/p><p>During its existence petitioner was operated substantially in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Shares of stock were issued as proposed and without any capital contributions therefor by the stockholders. Horine advanced $500 to petitioner at the time of its organization, which amount was repaid to Horine by petitioner from receipts from the liquidation. The title to the property involved was vested in Broders and Van Valkenburgh as trustees. The deeds of conveyances in selling the realty being liquidated were executed by the trustees. Petitioner was not a party to these conveyances. The money received by the trustees, as liquidation of the property progressed, was deposited in petitioner's bank account and the expenses of rehabilitation, maintenance and liquidation were paid by petitioner from these funds. Any funds remaining<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"5\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*174 <\/span> were from time to time distributed by petitioner to Horine and Broders as provided in the June 2 agreement. Prior to 1944 petitioner filed returns reporting as its income the gain derived from the liquidation of the properties. Thereafter, it filed returns but did not report as its income any such gains. <\/p><p>On May 31, 1946, petitioner was dissolved and Broders and Van Valkenburgh, under a supplemental agreement, are carrying on the functions previously performed by petitioner. <\/p><p>Opinion <\/p><p>The question is whether income realized from the liquidation process during the taxable year is taxable to petitioner. Respondent argues it is because petitioner as a corporate and taxable entity can not be disregarded and that therefore the income in question must be attributed to it for tax purposes. Petitioner contends that it was just an agent or conduit in respect of the income and is not, therefore, taxable. We think petitioner is not taxable. <\/p><p>Petitioner was formed pursuant to and subject to the terms of the June 2, 1934, agreement. This agreement provided that the petitioner would distribute the proceeds of the liquidation in a certain manner. This provision ante-dated petitioner's creation<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"6\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*175 <\/span> and petitioner was created subject to this requirement and for the purpose of satisfying it. There was no right, power or discretion in petitioner with respect to the disposition of the income in question. Petitioner did not, after its creation, obligate itself to distribute the income a certain way. Petitioner was powerless to have assumed such obligation. Petitioner's lack of command over the income is not the result of ignoring petitioner as a corporate or taxable entity but is a result of the agreement which prescribed and controlled the disposition of the income involved. In this respect the instant case differs from  , wherein the Court said: \"There was no actual contract of agency, nor the usual incidents of an agency relationship.\" <\/p><p>Since, in our opinion, command over the income is the essential matter here we do not consider it necessary to determine where ownership of the property being liquidated lay. Nor do we think petitioner's distribution of the income can in any way be confused with dividends. Even if called such, the distributions were not the result of petitioner's authority to declare them. Nor did<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"7\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*176 <\/span> the directors or stockholders have power to alter the pattern or character of the distributions since these were governed by the basic agreement of June 2, 1934. Furthermore, the distributions did not correspond with stock ownership. The fact that prior to 1944 petitioner returned income from the liquidation as its own does not affect our conclusion. Convinced as we are that petitioner had no command over the income in question, we hold that petitioner is not liable for any tax on it. See  . <\/p><p>Decision will be entered for petitioner.  <\/p><\/bodytext><\/div><\/div><\/div>","xml_harvard":"nan","html_with_citations":"<div class=\"courtcasedochead col-12\"><div class=\"caseinfo\"><div class=\"casename\"><div class=\"fullcasename\">Silver Bluff Estates, Inc. v.

The by-laws, in this connection, stated: <\/p><p>\"It being the intention of the incorporators of Silver Bluffs Estates, Inc., that the future<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"4\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*173 <\/span> management and affairs of this corporation be conducted in accordance with the intent of that certain Agreement * * * dated June 2 1934, and the said Agreement is herein set out and made a part of these by-laws.\" <\/p><p>The by-laws further provided that dividends \"shall be declared in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement dated June 2, 1934, * * *.\" <\/p><p>During its existence petitioner was operated substantially in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Shares of stock were issued as proposed and without any capital contributions therefor by the stockholders. Horine advanced $500 to petitioner at the time of its organization, which amount was repaid to Horine by petitioner from receipts from the liquidation. The title to the property involved was vested in Broders and Van Valkenburgh as trustees. The deeds of conveyances in selling the realty being liquidated were executed by the trustees. Petitioner was not a party to these conveyances. The money received by the trustees, as liquidation of the property progressed, was deposited in petitioner's bank account and the expenses of rehabilitation, maintenance and liquidation were paid by petitioner from these funds. Any funds remaining<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"5\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*174 <\/span> were from time to time distributed by petitioner to Horine and Broders as provided in the June 2 agreement. Prior to 1944 petitioner filed returns reporting as its income the gain derived from the liquidation of the properties. Thereafter, it filed returns but did not report as its income any such gains. <\/p><p>On May 31, 1946, petitioner was dissolved and Broders and Van Valkenburgh, under a supplemental agreement, are carrying on the functions previously performed by petitioner. <\/p><p>Opinion <\/p><p>The question is whether income realized from the liquidation process during the taxable year is taxable to petitioner. Respondent argues it is because petitioner as a corporate and taxable entity can not be disregarded and that therefore the income in question must be attributed to it for tax purposes. Petitioner contends that it was just an agent or conduit in respect of the income and is not, therefore, taxable. We think petitioner is not taxable. <\/p><p>Petitioner was formed pursuant to and subject to the terms of the June 2, 1934, agreement. This agreement provided that the petitioner would distribute the proceeds of the liquidation in a certain manner. This provision ante-dated petitioner's creation<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"6\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*175 <\/span> and petitioner was created subject to this requirement and for the purpose of satisfying it. There was no right, power or discretion in petitioner with respect to the disposition of the income in question. Petitioner did not, after its creation, obligate itself to distribute the income a certain way. Petitioner was powerless to have assumed such obligation. Petitioner's lack of command over the income is not the result of ignoring petitioner as a corporate or taxable entity but is a result of the agreement which prescribed and controlled the disposition of the income involved. In this respect the instant case differs from  , wherein the Court said: \"There was no actual contract of agency, nor the usual incidents of an agency relationship.\" <\/p><p>Since, in our opinion, command over the income is the essential matter here we do not consider it necessary to determine where ownership of the property being liquidated lay. Nor do we think petitioner's distribution of the income can in any way be confused with dividends. Even if called such, the distributions were not the result of petitioner's authority to declare them. Nor did<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"7\" pagescheme=\"1947 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*176 <\/span> the directors or stockholders have power to alter the pattern or character of the distributions since these were governed by the basic agreement of June 2, 1934. Furthermore, the distributions did not correspond with stock ownership. The fact that prior to 1944 petitioner returned income from the liquidation as its own does not affect our conclusion. Convinced as we are that petitioner had no command over the income in question, we hold that petitioner is not liable for any tax on it. See  . <\/p><p>Decision will be entered for petitioner.  <\/p><\/bodytext><\/div><\/div><\/div>","extracted_by_ocr":"f","author_id":"nan","cluster_id":"4808114"}

It filed consolidated returns for the tax years with the director of internal revenue at Boston. It has been engaged at all times material hereto in the sale of fuel oil at retail. <\/p><p>John James, Hugh Daniel and Ambrose McGillis, brothers, were engaged as partners in the business of selling, installing and servicing oil burning heating equipment in the area in and around Brockton. They later incorporated that business under the name of McGillis Service Engineering, <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"2\" pagescheme=\"1966 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*171 <\/span> Inc. Neither the partnership nor the corporation was ever engaged in or authorized to engage in the business of a dealer in or seller of fuel oil. However, the McGillises recommended a retail seller of fuel oil to their customers from whom to buy fuel oil, and many of their customers followed those recommendations, even changing from one retailer to another at the suggestion of the McGillises. <\/p><p>The petitioner and the McGillis partnership entered into an agreement dated June 1, 1939 under which the partnership granted to the petitioner \"the exclusive privilege of supplying fuel oils to all customers and users\" of the partnership and the petitioner agreed to pay the partnership a commission of one-half cent per gallon on all sales in the Brockton area. That arrangement continued but at some time in 1954 the petitioner and McGillis Service Engineering, Inc. entered into a new oral agreement under which the payment of the commissions was to continue and a subsidiary of the petitioner was to take over the business of selling, installing and servicing oil heating equipment formerly conducted by Service Engineering. The latter had been using solely the Hayward oil burner and parts, owned<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"3\" pagescheme=\"1966 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*172 <\/span> and supplied by a subsidiary of the petitioner. <\/p><p>The petitioner, Southern Massachusetts Oil Corporation, paid the following amounts as commissions to McGillis Service Engineering, Inc. and claimed them as deductions on its returns for its fiscal years ended September 30: 1958 - $15,922.37; 1959 - $17,239.33; 1960 - $15,405.85; and 1961 - $16,096.41. The Commissioner, in determining the deficiencies, disallowed those deductions and explained that they were \"paid for the acquisition of a capital asset\" and \"hence are not deductible.\" <\/p><p>All stipulated facts are incorporated herein by this reference. <\/p><p>Opinion <\/p><p>MURDOCK, Judge: The McGillis' brothers as partners and later as owners of Service Engineering, had been engaged for many years in the business of selling, installing and servicing oil burning heaters in the Brockton area. They had advised their customers to buy their fuel oil from the petitioner and the petitioner had agreed to pay and had regularly paid commissions to the partnership and later to the corporation on the sales which it thus was able to make. The amount of the commissions depended upon the number of gallons sold by the petitioner to its customers in the Brockton<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"4\" pagescheme=\"1966 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*173 <\/span> area in each year. <\/p><p>The oil burner and parts which Service Engineering had been installing for a number of years up to 1954 were obtained from a subsidiary of the petitioner. Hugh McGillis came to Raymond E. Skladzien, president of the petitioner, in 1954 and suggested that the petitioner take over the oil heater business of Service Engineering but continue to pay it the commissions on the petitioner's Brockton area fuel oil sales. The business of Service Engineering had been declining but Skladzien thought it might be improved. McGillis wanted to be relieved of the business of selling, installing and servicing oil heaters. McGillis and Skladzien agreed that Service Engineering would continue to receive the commissions on the petitioner's sales of fuel oil in the Brockton area and the business of the sale, installation and servicing of oil burners would be purchased by the petitioner and conducted by a subsidiary. The petitioner formed a wholly-owned subsidiary named McGillis Heating Service, Inc. which took over the business of selling, installing and servicing oil heaters. The petitioner paid Service Engineering in full for that business as Heating Service had no funds for that<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"5\" pagescheme=\"1966 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*174 <\/span> purpose. The petitioner also loaned Service Engineering $35,000 which was to be repaid, without interest, and was repaid within two years, from the commissions on heating oil sales due the borrower from the lender. <\/p><p>McGillis and the petitioner each had an attorney who, together, were to take care of the legal aspects of the oral agreement. They delayed, for unexplained reasons, until December 29, 1955, when a written agreement was presented for execution by McGillis and Skladzien. It named Service Engineering as seller and Heating Service as buyer. The petitioner was not named as a party to it. McGillis signed it on behalf of the seller and Skladzien signed it as president of the buyer, Heating Service. It correctly stated that Heating Service was buying the seller's good will and trade name of its business of selling, installing and servicing oil burners and heating equipment in the territory described therein. However, it incorrectly stated that Heating Service was also buying the good will and trade name of the seller's \"business of selling fuel oil.\" The seller was not authorized to engage in business as a dealer in or seller of fuel oil and it had no such business to sell. Heating<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"6\" pagescheme=\"1966 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*175 <\/span> Service was not authorized to engage in any such business and did not purchase or pay for any such business.  The agreement also stated erroneously that Heating Service was to pay to the seller, \"as consideration for the foregoing,\" commissions quarterly for a period of ten years \"on deliveries by the Buyer and\/or Southern Massachusetts Oil Corporation or their successors and assigns, of #2 fuel oil within the territory, as follows:\" and there followed details regarding the rates per gallon to be paid. <\/p><p>The Commissioner, relying upon the erroneous statements in the agreement of December 29, 1955, argues that the petitioner by payment of the commissions to Service Engineering was buying a capital asset. He does not always identify the capital asset but apparently he means the good will and trade name of Service Engineering's \"business of selling fuel oil,\" as mentioned in the December 29, 1955, agreement between Service Engineering and Heating Service. Not only was the petitioner not a party to the agreement but in fact Service Engineering never had any such business and could not and did not transfer any fuel oil selling business to the petitioner in December 1955 or by that agreement. <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"7\" pagescheme=\"1966 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 170\">*176 <\/span> Other documents in evidence prepared at the same time as the December 29, 1955, agreement contain erroneous statements similar to those in that agreement. <\/p><p>The petitioner alone of the parties herein mentioned, was a dealer in and a seller of fuel oil at retail. It had conducted that business and paid commissions to the McGillis interests for many years. The commissions which it paid after December 1955 to Service Engineering were no different in purpose or character from those paid previously. Its customer lists were not made larger and the commissions which it paid to Service Engineering were not made more onerous by the agreement of December 29, 1955, to which it was not a party. <\/p><p>This case should be decided upon what actually took place rather than upon misleading statements in the written agreement which are obviously untrue and contrary to the facts of the transactions which actually took place. The \"facts\" relied upon by the Commissioner not only do not reflect what actually occurred but reflect actions which could not have taken place.

The stipulations, together with the exhibits <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"4\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*172 <\/span> attached thereto, are incorporated herein by this reference.<\/p><p>Petitioner is an Ohio corporation having its principal office in Cincinnati, Ohio, at the time it filed its petition herein.  Its Federal income tax returns for the years 1958 to 1962, inclusive, were filed with the district director of internal revenue, Cincinnati, Ohio.<\/p><p>Petitioner is a mutual life insurance company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Ohio.  Its operations and accounts are subject to the supervision and approval of the superintendent of insurance for the State of Ohio and, because it does business in numerous States, it is subject to periodic audit of its accounts by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which acts on behalf of the insurance departments of the various States.<\/p><p>The tax returns filed in the years here involved were prepared on the same basis as was used on the annual statement required of life insurance companies by the NAIC, with some adjustments.<\/p><p>In life insurance, premiums are the agreed price for assuming and carrying the risk.  Gross premium is the amount actually charged the insured and is composed of the net valuation premium and \"loading.\" The<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"5\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*173 <\/span> net valuation premium on a particular policy is that amount of money which, using the mortality table and interest rate assumed for the policy, will be exactly sufficient to provide the benefits of the policy and is required by State law to be added to the policy reserve each year.  \"Loading\" refers to an amount added to the net valuation premium for estimated administration, management, and operating expenses, contingencies, profits in the case of capital stock companies, and dividends in the case of mutual companies.  The amount of \"loading\" results from an independent judgment of each particular company and may vary from company to company.  Policyholders may pay premiums in semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly installments.  An additional amount is added when an installment method of paying the premium is elected.<\/p><p><span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"1038\" pagescheme=\"55 T.C. 1036\">*1038 <\/span> \"Deferred and uncollected premiums\" are the premiums on policies with premiums payable more often than annually which become due after December 31 of the calendar year and before the next policy anniversary date.<\/p><p>\"Due and unpaid premiums\" are premiums which are due to be paid before the end of the year, but which have not been paid by December 31.  As<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"6\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*174 <\/span> required by law, all policies provide for a 31-day grace period for the payment of premiums after their due date, during which period the policy is carried in full force and effect.<\/p><p>\"Deferred and uncollected premiums\" and \"due and unpaid premiums\" are hereinafter sometimes referred to as due and deferred premiums. <sup id=\"fnr_fnote2\"><a href=\"#fn_fnote2\" id=\"\">2<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p>There is no obligation, legal or otherwise, on an insured to pay to the insurer due and deferred premiums. If the policyholder does not pay the premium in conformity with the provisions of the policy, the policy is lapsed after the grace period and appropriate adjustments are made.<\/p><p>Petitioner was required by the State of Ohio and by the NAIC to compute its reserves on the great majority of its life insurance policies on the assumption that premiums were paid<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"7\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*175 <\/span> up 1 year in advance on each anniversary date commencing with the issuance date of the policy, even though premiums were not usually paid in this manner.  The reserves so computed were reflected as a liability of petitioner and, as required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959, <sup id=\"fnr_fnote3\"><a href=\"#fn_fnote3\" id=\"\">3<\/a><\/sup> were taken into account in the computations required under <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0MX0000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\">sections 805<\/span><\/content><\/span> and <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0MY0000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 809\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 809\">809<\/span><\/content><\/span> on the Federal income tax returns filed by petitioner for the taxable years 1958 to 1962, inclusive.<\/p><p>The NAIC annual statement treats deferred and uncollected premiums on a net basis.  Item 17, on the assets page of the balance sheet, calls for the statement of \"Life insurance premiums and annuity considerations deferred and uncollected\" on a net premium basis.  Exhibit 13 of the annual statement, which gives the detail of the assets, sets forth deferred and uncollected<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"8\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*176 <\/span> premiums on a net basis.  It provides for a memorandum account to show the amount of loading excluded from the deferred and uncollected premiums. Item 16 of the liabilities page of the balance sheet calls for a statement of the \"'Cost of collection' on premiums and annuity considerations deferred and uncollected in excess of total loading thereon.\" As required by the NAIC annual statement, petitioner's annual statements showed net <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"1039\" pagescheme=\"55 T.C. 1036\">*1039 <\/span> premiums deferred and uncollected as an asset.  Also in conformity with the form, petitioner's annual statement did not show loading as an asset.<\/p><p>In the summary of operations contained in the NAIC annual statements, line 1.1, \"Premiums and annuity considerations,\" includes deferred and uncollected premiums on a gross basis.  It (line 1.1) provides for the inclusion of such premiums at gross to be added to gross premiums collected during the year less deferred and uncollected premiums at gross as of the end of the previous year.  Line 17, which is the \"Increase in aggregate reserve for policies and contracts with life contingencies,\" removes from income the net portion of the deferred and uncollected premiums. Line 25 provides for the deduction<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"9\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*177 <\/span> of the increase in loading on deferred and uncollected premiums and also for the deduction of cost of collection of premiums in excess of loading on deferred and uncollected premiums. In determining net gain from operations, lines 8 through 26A of the Summary of Operations list various allowable deductions, including the deduction in line 25 for increase in loading on deferred and uncollected premiums. This deduction was claimed by petitioner on its Federal income tax returns in determining its net gain from operations.  Exclusive of increases in loading, the petitioner deducted all expenses actually paid or incurred each year on its NAIC annual statements and Federal income tax returns.<\/p><p>In its income tax returns for the years involved, petitioner did not include any due and deferred premiums as an asset, but it now concedes that they should be so included in an amount equal to the net valuation premiums. In these returns, petitioner did include, as an income item, an amount of due and deferred premiums equal to the deductions for increase in loading and increase in reserves.<\/p><p>OPINION<\/p><p>This case presents two issues relating to the interpretation and application of the Life Insurance<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"10\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct.

See H. Rept. No. 34, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1-8 (1959); S. Rept. No. 291, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1-12 (1959).<\/p><p>Section 802(b) sets out a three-phase approach which is to be followed in computing a life insurance company's taxable income.  <sup id=\"fnr_fnote4\"><a href=\"#fn_fnote4\" id=\"\">4<\/a><\/sup> In <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"1040\" pagescheme=\"55 T.C. 1036\">*1040 <\/span> arriving at taxable investment income and gain from operations, the 1959 Act recognizes that life insurance companies are legally obligated to keep policyholder reserves in order to meet future claims, that they normally add a significant portion of their investment income to these reserves, and that these annual reserve increments should not be subjected to tax.  <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0N30000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">United States <\/emphasis>v.<emphasis typestyle=\"it\"> Atlas Ins.

The Act thus attempts to tax only those portions of investment income and premium income which represent profit to the company, legally available for distribution to policyholders or stockholders as dividends, as distinguished from those gains which, under State<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"11\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct.

In view of the detailed analysis contained in the various opinions in these cases, we are relieved of the necessity of exposition beyond what is essential to the articulation of our position herein.<\/p><p>The two issues requiring decision stem from certain propositions which are not in dispute: (1) That life insurance reserves are properly taken into account in computing the numerator of a fraction utilized in determining the amount to be eliminated from \"investment income,\" subject to the so-called phase I tax; (2) that the annual increase in such reserves is a proper deduction in determining gain from operations, which is subject to the so-called phase II tax; (3) that such reserves include a purported liability in an amount computed on the assumption that premiums are paid up 1 year in advance on each anniversary date commencing<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"13\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*181 <\/span> with the issuance date of the policy; and (4) that, to the extent of such amount, a liability is recognized which does not reflect the normal requirements of accrual accounting.<\/p><p>The first issue to be resolved is the extent to which due and deferred premiums should be taken into account in computing the amount of \"assets\" as defined in <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0NY0000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805 (b)(4)\">section 805(b)(4)<\/span><\/content><\/span>, <sup id=\"fnr_fnote5\"><a href=\"#fn_fnote5\" id=\"\">5<\/a><\/sup> an amount which is in the <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"1041\" pagescheme=\"55 T.C. 1036\">*1041 <\/span> denominator of a fraction whose numerator includes \"life insurance reserves.\" The fraction is a key element in determining the policyholders' share of investment income which is to be excluded from taxable investment income and consequently not subject to the so-called phase I tax.  Obviously, the smaller the denominator, the larger the fraction and therefore the greater the amount to be excluded and the smaller the amount subject to tax.  Respondent argues that the word \"assets\" should include the gross amount of due and deferred premiums. He bases his contention on the following syllogism: (1) Life insurance reserves are included in the numerator of the fraction; (2) those reserves include an amount attributable to due and deferred premiums computed, as previously indicated, on the assumption<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"14\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*182 <\/span> that premiums are paid 1 year in advance; (3) such an assumption having furnished the underpinning for the computation of an element in the numerator of the fraction, the same assumption should control the determination of the denominator of the fraction. Or, to put it another way, respondent contends that, since the liability represented by life insurance reserves is based on the premise that the item giving rise to such liability has been received, the same premise must be utilized in computing the assets which are subject to such liability.<\/p><p><span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"15\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*183 <\/span>We think respondent's syllogism proves too much.  Initially, we point out that the assumption upon which respondent relies so heavily has its roots in the procedures of the NAIC and presumably the requirements of State law with respect to the necessity of establishing reserves.  There is no indication in the statute itself or the legislative history that such an assumption was the foundation for the statutory provision permitting the liability, represented by reserves allocated to due and deferred premiums, to be taken into account.  See H. Rept. No. 34, <emphasis typestyle=\"it\">supra<\/emphasis>; S. Rept. No. 291, <emphasis typestyle=\"it\">supra<\/emphasis>; H. Rept. No. 520, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959); but see <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0P20000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">Franklin Life Insurance Co. <\/emphasis>v.<emphasis typestyle=\"it\"> United States<\/emphasis>, <span normalizedcite=\"399 F.2d 757\">399 F. 2d at 761<\/span><\/content><\/span>. Only if we were to adopt an osmotic view of legislative intent could we say that the assumption in question was the foundation for legislative action and, even in such a circumstance, we would have to extend the process of osmosis from a determination of the composition of life insurance reserves to a determination of the meaning of the word \"assets.\" This we are not prepared to do.<\/p><p>Section 818(a) specifically provides:<\/p><p>SEC. 818.  ACCOUNTING<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"16\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct.

Neither party herein disputes the proposition<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"17\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*185 <\/span> that, since petitioner had no legal right to collect due and deferred premiums, they would not normally be includable under an accrual method of accounting. Indeed, were it not for the specific provisions in <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0P30000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\">section 805<\/span><\/content><\/span>, permitting life insurance reserves to be taken into account, the portion of those reserves attributable to the liability, which would have come into existence if and when the due and deferred premiums had been paid, would also not be recognized under the accrual method of accounting.<\/p><p>In view of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the fact that Congress injected a limited modification of the normal rules of accrual accounting with respect to life insurance reserves does not justify an expansive interpretation of the word \"assets\" in <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0P40000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805 (b)(4)\">section 805(b)(4)<\/span><\/content><\/span>.  To hold otherwise would in effect result in the creation for tax purposes of an otherwise nonexistent asset.  In an analogous situation, we have only recently reaffirmed our refusal to permit respondent to utilize section 482 to allocate nonexistent income.  <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0P60000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">Huber Homes, Inc<\/emphasis>., <span normalizedcite=\"55 T.C. 598\">55 T.C.  598<\/span> (1971)<\/content><\/span>. Nor are we impressed with respondent's argument that adoption of his position is necessary<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"18\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*186 <\/span> to prevent distortion. In point of fact, whenever amounts are added to both a numerator and denominator, the fraction is distorted from what it would have been without the additions unless the amounts so added are in the same proportion as the other amounts utilized in determining the fraction. The siren song of symmetry which underlies respondent's argument regarding distortion is beside the point.  Symmetry between income and deductions is not a necessary touchstone for determining the incidence of Federal income taxation, even where such symmetry is consistent with sound accounting practice.  Cf.  <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0PB0000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">Schlude <\/emphasis>v.<emphasis typestyle=\"it\"> Commissioner<\/emphasis>, <span normalizedcite=\"372 U.S. 128\">372 U.S. 128<\/span> (1963)<\/content><\/span>; <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0PG0000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">American Automobile Assn. <\/emphasis>v.<emphasis typestyle=\"it\"> United States<\/emphasis>, <span normalizedcite=\"367 U.S. 687\">367 U.S. 687<\/span>, <span normalizedcite=\"367 U.S. 687\">692<\/span> (1961)<\/content><\/span>.<\/p><p>Perhaps there would be less distortion under respondent's method.  Cf. our supplemental opinion in <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0PM0000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">Western National Life Insurance Co. of Texas<\/emphasis>, <span normalizedcite=\"51 T.C. 824\">51 T.C. 824<\/span>, <span normalizedcite=\"51 T.C. 824\">826-827<\/span> (1969)<\/content><\/span>. But this may not necessarily be <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"1043\" pagescheme=\"55 T.C. 1036\">*1043 <\/span> so and, in any event, we are not disposed to create an accruable asset simply because the statute specifically permits an otherwise nonaccruable liability to<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"19\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct.

We so conclude, not because we consider the NAIC treatment binding upon us or respondent, but because, given the clear indication that the normal rules of accrual accounting should be applied to the taxation of life insurance companies, except as modified by statute, and the fact that the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 represents a carefully drawn, detailed framework of taxation in an unusually complicated area, we think that the word \"assets\" -- a word of ordinary usage -- should be given its accepted meaning.

The life insurance business involves many concepts and practices which are peculiar to that business, and the income which should be subject to taxation cannot be determined without taking into consideration those peculiar concepts and practices.  It is, moreover, a business which is generally subject to regulation by the States, and through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, uniform standards are established.

Generally, it is our duty to decide a question in accordance with our best judgment.  It would be irresponsible, in my opinion, for us to abrogate our own power to decide an issue and to accept the decision of another court merely because one other court had passed upon the question.  Yet, we are not<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"26\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*194 <\/span> wholly free to expound the law as we may see it.  Of course, we are constrained to give effect to our own precedents and to follow the decision of a circuit when the law has been established by decision of the Court of Appeals for that circuit.  <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0T20000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">Jack E.

Even when the Court of Appeals has not spoken for the circuit in which the case arises, we do give serious consideration to the views of other circuits.  At times, we may decide to continue to adhere to our view even though a Court of Appeals in a different circuit takes a different position.  However, if many of the circuit courts adopt a position contrary to ours, there must come a time when we accede to their views, however much we may be convinced of the correctness of our view.<\/p><p>There is no magic in the number of three -- there is no number of contrary decisions by the circuit courts which, in my view, should automatically cause us to accede to their views.

Under such circumstances, I believe that we should reconsider our position and accept the views of the circuits.<\/p><p>No one can predict with certainty how the Sixth Circuit will decide the issue, but we can be sure that they will give great weight to the views of the other Circuit Courts of Appeals.  <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0T60000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"432 F.2d 298\"><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">Western National Life Insurance Co. of Texas <\/emphasis>v.<emphasis typestyle=\"it\"> Commissioner, supra<\/emphasis><\/span><\/content><\/span><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">;<\/emphasis><span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0T80000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">Goodenow <\/emphasis>v.<emphasis typestyle=\"it\"> Commissioner<\/emphasis>, <span normalizedcite=\"238 F.2d 20\">238 F. 2d 20<\/span><\/content><\/span> (C.A. 8, 1956).

LEXIS 169\">*172 <\/span> attached thereto, are incorporated herein by this reference.<\/p><p>Petitioner is an Ohio corporation having its principal office in Cincinnati, Ohio, at the time it filed its petition herein.  Its Federal income tax returns for the years 1958 to 1962, inclusive, were filed with the district director of internal revenue, Cincinnati, Ohio.<\/p><p>Petitioner is a mutual life insurance company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Ohio.  Its operations and accounts are subject to the supervision and approval of the superintendent of insurance for the State of Ohio and, because it does business in numerous States, it is subject to periodic audit of its accounts by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which acts on behalf of the insurance departments of the various States.<\/p><p>The tax returns filed in the years here involved were prepared on the same basis as was used on the annual statement required of life insurance companies by the NAIC, with some adjustments.<\/p><p>In life insurance, premiums are the agreed price for assuming and carrying the risk.  Gross premium is the amount actually charged the insured and is composed of the net valuation premium and \"loading.\" The<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"5\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*173 <\/span> net valuation premium on a particular policy is that amount of money which, using the mortality table and interest rate assumed for the policy, will be exactly sufficient to provide the benefits of the policy and is required by State law to be added to the policy reserve each year.  \"Loading\" refers to an amount added to the net valuation premium for estimated administration, management, and operating expenses, contingencies, profits in the case of capital stock companies, and dividends in the case of mutual companies.  The amount of \"loading\" results from an independent judgment of each particular company and may vary from company to company.  Policyholders may pay premiums in semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly installments.  An additional amount is added when an installment method of paying the premium is elected.<\/p><p><span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"1038\" pagescheme=\"55 T.C. 1036\">*1038 <\/span> \"Deferred and uncollected premiums\" are the premiums on policies with premiums payable more often than annually which become due after December 31 of the calendar year and before the next policy anniversary date.<\/p><p>\"Due and unpaid premiums\" are premiums which are due to be paid before the end of the year, but which have not been paid by December 31.  As<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"6\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*174 <\/span> required by law, all policies provide for a 31-day grace period for the payment of premiums after their due date, during which period the policy is carried in full force and effect.<\/p><p>\"Deferred and uncollected premiums\" and \"due and unpaid premiums\" are hereinafter sometimes referred to as due and deferred premiums. <sup id=\"fnr_fnote2\"><a href=\"#fn_fnote2\" id=\"\">2<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p>There is no obligation, legal or otherwise, on an insured to pay to the insurer due and deferred premiums. If the policyholder does not pay the premium in conformity with the provisions of the policy, the policy is lapsed after the grace period and appropriate adjustments are made.<\/p><p>Petitioner was required by the State of Ohio and by the NAIC to compute its reserves on the great majority of its life insurance policies on the assumption that premiums were paid<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"7\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct.

The reserves so computed were reflected as a liability of petitioner and, as required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959, <sup id=\"fnr_fnote3\"><a href=\"#fn_fnote3\" id=\"\">3<\/a><\/sup> were taken into account in the computations required under <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0MX0000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\">sections 805<\/span><\/content><\/span> and <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0MY0000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 809\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 809\">809<\/span><\/content><\/span> on the Federal income tax returns filed by petitioner for the taxable years 1958 to 1962, inclusive.<\/p><p>The NAIC annual statement treats deferred and uncollected premiums on a net basis.  Item 17, on the assets page of the balance sheet, calls for the statement of \"Life insurance premiums and annuity considerations deferred and uncollected\" on a net premium basis.  Exhibit 13 of the annual statement, which gives the detail of the assets, sets forth deferred and uncollected<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"8\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*176 <\/span> premiums on a net basis.  It provides for a memorandum account to show the amount of loading excluded from the deferred and uncollected premiums. Item 16 of the liabilities page of the balance sheet calls for a statement of the \"'Cost of collection' on premiums and annuity considerations deferred and uncollected in excess of total loading thereon.\" As required by the NAIC annual statement, petitioner's annual statements showed net <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"1039\" pagescheme=\"55 T.C. 1036\">*1039 <\/span> premiums deferred and uncollected as an asset.  Also in conformity with the form, petitioner's annual statement did not show loading as an asset.<\/p><p>In the summary of operations contained in the NAIC annual statements, line 1.1, \"Premiums and annuity considerations,\" includes deferred and uncollected premiums on a gross basis.  It (line 1.1) provides for the inclusion of such premiums at gross to be added to gross premiums collected during the year less deferred and uncollected premiums at gross as of the end of the previous year.  Line 17, which is the \"Increase in aggregate reserve for policies and contracts with life contingencies,\" removes from income the net portion of the deferred and uncollected premiums. Line 25 provides for the deduction<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"9\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*177 <\/span> of the increase in loading on deferred and uncollected premiums and also for the deduction of cost of collection of premiums in excess of loading on deferred and uncollected premiums. In determining net gain from operations, lines 8 through 26A of the Summary of Operations list various allowable deductions, including the deduction in line 25 for increase in loading on deferred and uncollected premiums. This deduction was claimed by petitioner on its Federal income tax returns in determining its net gain from operations.  Exclusive of increases in loading, the petitioner deducted all expenses actually paid or incurred each year on its NAIC annual statements and Federal income tax returns.<\/p><p>In its income tax returns for the years involved, petitioner did not include any due and deferred premiums as an asset, but it now concedes that they should be so included in an amount equal to the net valuation premiums. In these returns, petitioner did include, as an income item, an amount of due and deferred premiums equal to the deductions for increase in loading and increase in reserves.<\/p><p>OPINION<\/p><p>This case presents two issues relating to the interpretation and application of the Life Insurance<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"10\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct.

In view of the detailed analysis contained in the various opinions in these cases, we are relieved of the necessity of exposition beyond what is essential to the articulation of our position herein.<\/p><p>The two issues requiring decision stem from certain propositions which are not in dispute: (1) That life insurance reserves are properly taken into account in computing the numerator of a fraction utilized in determining the amount to be eliminated from \"investment income,\" subject to the so-called phase I tax; (2) that the annual increase in such reserves is a proper deduction in determining gain from operations, which is subject to the so-called phase II tax; (3) that such reserves include a purported liability in an amount computed on the assumption that premiums are paid up 1 year in advance on each anniversary date commencing<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"13\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*181 <\/span> with the issuance date of the policy; and (4) that, to the extent of such amount, a liability is recognized which does not reflect the normal requirements of accrual accounting.<\/p><p>The first issue to be resolved is the extent to which due and deferred premiums should be taken into account in computing the amount of \"assets\" as defined in <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0NY0000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805 (b)(4)\">section 805(b)(4)<\/span><\/content><\/span>, <sup id=\"fnr_fnote5\"><a href=\"#fn_fnote5\" id=\"\">5<\/a><\/sup> an amount which is in the <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"1041\" pagescheme=\"55 T.C. 1036\">*1041 <\/span> denominator of a fraction whose numerator includes \"life insurance reserves.\" The fraction is a key element in determining the policyholders' share of investment income which is to be excluded from taxable investment income and consequently not subject to the so-called phase I tax.  Obviously, the smaller the denominator, the larger the fraction and therefore the greater the amount to be excluded and the smaller the amount subject to tax.  Respondent argues that the word \"assets\" should include the gross amount of due and deferred premiums. He bases his contention on the following syllogism: (1) Life insurance reserves are included in the numerator of the fraction; (2) those reserves include an amount attributable to due and deferred premiums computed, as previously indicated, on the assumption<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"14\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*182 <\/span> that premiums are paid 1 year in advance; (3) such an assumption having furnished the underpinning for the computation of an element in the numerator of the fraction, the same assumption should control the determination of the denominator of the fraction. Or, to put it another way, respondent contends that, since the liability represented by life insurance reserves is based on the premise that the item giving rise to such liability has been received, the same premise must be utilized in computing the assets which are subject to such liability.<\/p><p><span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"15\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*183 <\/span>We think respondent's syllogism proves too much.  Initially, we point out that the assumption upon which respondent relies so heavily has its roots in the procedures of the NAIC and presumably the requirements of State law with respect to the necessity of establishing reserves.  There is no indication in the statute itself or the legislative history that such an assumption was the foundation for the statutory provision permitting the liability, represented by reserves allocated to due and deferred premiums, to be taken into account.  See H. Rept. No. 34, <emphasis typestyle=\"it\">supra<\/emphasis>; S. Rept. No. 291, <emphasis typestyle=\"it\">supra<\/emphasis>; H. Rept. No. 520, 86th Cong., 1st Sess.

Only if we were to adopt an osmotic view of legislative intent could we say that the assumption in question was the foundation for legislative action and, even in such a circumstance, we would have to extend the process of osmosis from a determination of the composition of life insurance reserves to a determination of the meaning of the word \"assets.\" This we are not prepared to do.<\/p><p>Section 818(a) specifically provides:<\/p><p>SEC. 818.

Neither party herein disputes the proposition<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"17\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*185 <\/span> that, since petitioner had no legal right to collect due and deferred premiums, they would not normally be includable under an accrual method of accounting. Indeed, were it not for the specific provisions in <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0P30000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\">section 805<\/span><\/content><\/span>, permitting life insurance reserves to be taken into account, the portion of those reserves attributable to the liability, which would have come into existence if and when the due and deferred premiums had been paid, would also not be recognized under the accrual method of accounting.<\/p><p>In view of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the fact that Congress injected a limited modification of the normal rules of accrual accounting with respect to life insurance reserves does not justify an expansive interpretation of the word \"assets\" in <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0P40000400\" name=\"citation\" normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805\" type=\"statute\"><content><span normalizedcite=\"26 U.S.C. 805 (b)(4)\">section 805(b)(4)<\/span><\/content><\/span>.  To hold otherwise would in effect result in the creation for tax purposes of an otherwise nonexistent asset.  In an analogous situation, we have only recently reaffirmed our refusal to permit respondent to utilize section 482 to allocate nonexistent income.  <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0P60000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">Huber Homes, Inc<\/emphasis>., <span normalizedcite=\"55 T.C. <span class=\"citation no-link\">598\">55 T.C.  598<\/span><\/span> (1971)<\/content><\/span>. Nor are we impressed with respondent's argument that adoption of his position is necessary<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"18\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*186 <\/span> to prevent distortion. In point of fact, whenever amounts are added to both a numerator and denominator, the fraction is distorted from what it would have been without the additions unless the amounts so added are in the same proportion as the other amounts utilized in determining the fraction. The siren song of symmetry which underlies respondent's argument regarding distortion is beside the point.  Symmetry between income and deductions is not a necessary touchstone for determining the incidence of Federal income taxation, even where such symmetry is consistent with sound accounting practice.

But this may not necessarily be <span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"1043\" pagescheme=\"55 T.C. 1036\">*1043 <\/span> so and, in any event, we are not disposed to create an accruable asset simply because the statute specifically permits an otherwise nonaccruable liability to<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"19\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct.

Generally, it is our duty to decide a question in accordance with our best judgment.

Yet, we are not<span class=\"star-pagination\" number=\"26\" pagescheme=\"1971 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 169\">*194 <\/span> wholly free to expound the law as we may see it.  Of course, we are constrained to give effect to our own precedents and to follow the decision of a circuit when the law has been established by decision of the Court of Appeals for that circuit.  <span id=\"I4NX1G580K1MNJ0T20000400\" name=\"citation\" type=\"case\"><content><emphasis typestyle=\"it\">Jack E.

Even when the Court of Appeals has not spoken for the circuit in which the case arises, we do give serious consideration to the views of other circuits.  At times, we may decide to continue to adhere to our view even though a Court of Appeals in a different circuit takes a different position.  However, if many of the circuit courts adopt a position contrary to ours, there must come a time when we accede to their views, however much we may be convinced of the correctness of our view.<\/p><p>There is no magic in the number of three -- there is no number of contrary decisions by the circuit courts which, in my view, should automatically cause us to accede to their views.

In view of the nature of the issue in controversy, it is difficult to demonstrate that those circuits were clearly erroneous, and it is difficult to give cogent reasons why the Sixth Circuit should not follow them.

Some students sued. Then\n   the district court permanently enjoined the Texas Attorney General from\n   enforcing GA-38. We hold, however, that the district court lacked subject-\n   matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s injunction and\n   remand with instructions to dismiss the suit without prejudice.\n                                          I.\n          GA-38 provides that \u201c[n]o governmental entity, including\n   a . . . school district . . . , and no government official may require any person\n   to wear a face covering or to mandate another person wear a face covering.\u201d\n   GA-38 has \u201cthe force and effect of law.\u201d Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 418.012.\n          Plaintiffs are children with disabilities attending Texas public schools.\n   On August 17, 2021, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in federal district court\n   challenging GA-38 and related Public Health Guidance from the Texas\n   Education Agency (\u201cTEA\u201d). The original complaint included 14 plaintiffs,\n   who were \u201cstudents with disabilities and underlying medical conditions\n   which carry an increased risk of serious complications or death in the event\n   that they contract COVID-19.\u201d It named as defendants Governor Abbott, the\n   TEA, and TEA Commissioner Mike Morath.\n          The original complaint included three claims: (1) violation of the\n   Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) against Abbott and Morath in\n   their official capacities, (2) violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n   of 1973 against all defendants, and (3) federal preemption under the\n   American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\u201cARP Act\u201d) against all defendants.\n   Plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief.\n          Plaintiffs amended their complaint twice before trial. First, on\n   September 1, they amended their complaint to add the Attorney General as a\n   defendant. Second, a week before trial, plaintiffs filed a second amended\n   complaint with leave of court, adding a new claim and subtracting some\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fCase: 21-51083      Document: 00516406497           Page: 3     Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 21-51083\n\n\n   plaintiffs and a defendant. The new claim alleged the ADA and\n   Rehabilitation Act preempted GA-38. Seven plaintiffs exited the suit, and the\n   seven remaining plaintiffs dropped their claims against the Governor.\n          After denying plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order and\n   preliminary injunction, the district court held a bench trial and entered a\n   permanent injunction and final judgment against the Attorney General. The\n   court held that plaintiffs have standing to sue. It then declared that GA-38\n   violates Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. It\n   further held that, insofar as it applies to school districts, GA-38 is preempted\n   by the ADA, Section 504, and the ARP Act. The court enjoined the\n   Attorney General from enforcing the Executive Order. The Attorney\n   General sought a stay pending appeal, which the district court denied. But\n   we granted the stay and expedited the appeal.\n                                          II.\n          \u201cArticle III jurisdiction is always first.

To invoke our\n   jurisdiction, plaintiffs must satisfy the familiar tripartite test for Article III\n   standing: (A) an injury in fact; (B) that\u2019s fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s\n   conduct; and (C) that\u2019s likely redressable by a favorable decision. See Lujan\n   v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992); see also Env\u2019t Tex. Citizen\n   Lobby, Inc. v. ExxonMobil Corp., 968 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir. 2020) (\u201cBecause\n   this case was tried, Plaintiffs needed to prove standing by a preponderance of\n   the evidence.\u201d). All three elements are missing here.\n                                          A.\n          Plaintiffs have not presented an injury in fact sufficient to satisfy\n   Article III. To establish such an injury, plaintiffs must show they \u201csuffered\n   an invasion of a legally protected interest that is \u2018concrete and particularized\u2019\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fCase: 21-51083      Document: 00516406497          Page: 4    Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 21-51083\n\n\n   and \u2018actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u2019\u201d Spokeo, Inc. v.\n   Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). Plaintiffs\n   haven\u2019t carried that burden here because (1) the injury they\u2019ve alleged is not\n   a cognizable injury in fact, and (2) they may not relabel their injury as\n   something it\u2019s not.\n                                         1.\n          Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury is the increased risk they face of contracting\n   COVID-19 in school without mask mandates and experiencing complications\n   or severe symptoms from a COVID-19 infection. They rely on their doctors\u2019\n   statements that \u201c[i]n order to decrease [plaintiffs\u2019] risk,\u201d everyone around\n   them \u201cshould observe strict COVID-19 safety protocols and wear a mask\n   indoors.\u201d Plaintiffs further contend that, without mask mandates, it is\n   \u201csimply too dangerous\u201d for them to attend in-person school.\n          To establish an injury in fact, plaintiffs must show an \u201cinvasion of a\n   legally protected interest\u201d that is both \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and\n   \u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Spokeo, 578 U.S. at\n   339 (quotation omitted). This circuit does not \u201crecognize the concept of\n   probabilistic standing based on a non-particularized increased risk\u2014that is,\n   an increased risk that equally affects the general public.\u201d Shrimpers, 968 F.3d\n   at 424 (quotation omitted). And even where increased-risk claims are\n   particularized, they generally \u201ccannot satisfy the actual or imminent\n   requirement,\u201d which necessitates \u201cevidence of a certainly impending harm\n   or substantial risk of harm.\u201d Ibid. (quotation omitted); see also Ctr. for\n   Biological Diversity v. EPA, 937 F.3d 533, 537 n.2 (5th Cir. 2019) (\u201c[A]ny\n   difference between \u2018certainly impending\u2019 and \u2018substantial risk\u2019 is immaterial\n   here.\u201d). That\u2019s because \u201c[m]uch government regulation slightly increases a\n   citizen\u2019s risk of injury\u2014or insufficiently decreases the risk compared to what\n   some citizens might prefer.\u201d Shrimpers, 968 F.3d at 424 (quoting Pub.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fCase: 21-51083      Document: 00516406497           Page: 5    Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 21-51083\n\n\n   Citizen, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 489 F.3d 1279, 1295\n   (D.C. Cir. 2007)). And \u201c[o]pening the courthouse to these kinds of\n   increased-risk claims would drain the \u2018actual or imminent\u2019 requirement of\n   meaning.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Pub. Citizen, 489 F.3d at 1295).\n          Plaintiffs\u2019 increased risk of contracting COVID-19 fails to satisfy these\n   requirements. There is no way to understand plaintiffs\u2019 trial evidence as\n   establishing COVID-19 infections are \u201ccertainly impending\u201d in schools\n   without mask mandates, but not in schools mandating masks. Shrimpers, 968\n   F.3d at 425. At the time of trial, two of plaintiffs\u2019 seven schools were mask-\n   optional (in compliance with GA-38), and five mandated masks (in violation\n   of GA-38). The two mask-optional schools had positivity rates of 1.9 and 3.0\n   percent. The five schools with mask mandates measured at 0.3, 1.1, 2.3, 4.9,\n   and 5.4 percent\u2014higher, lower, and in between the rates from the mask-\n   optional schools. Moreover, plaintiffs did nothing to control for their\n   schools\u2019 various other efforts to reduce COVID-19 infections, and hence did\n   nothing to prove the relative efficacy of mask mandates in the five law-\n   violating schools. Cf. Dominguez v. UAL Corp., 666 F.3d 1359, 1363 (D.C. Cir.\n   2012) (concluding antitrust plaintiff\u2019s alleged injury was \u201cspeculative at\n   best\u201d because it failed to take into account numerous variables at play);\n   Finkelman v. Nat\u2019l Football League, 810 F.3d 187, 202 (3d Cir. 2016) (similar);\n   Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, 405 F.3d 964, 985 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding\n   alleged injury did \u201cnot rise to the level of certainty required to establish an\n   injury in fact\u201d where injury depended on a \u201cseries of substantial variables,\n   over which [the plaintiff] himself had utterly no control\u201d); cf. also Simon v. E.\n   Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976) (\u201c[U]nadorned speculation\n   will not suffice to invoke the federal judicial power.\u201d); United Transp. Union\n   v. ICC, 891 F.2d 908, 915 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (\u201cAny one of the factors discussed\n   above might be enough to place the petitioner\u2019s allegation in the category of\n   unadorned speculation, and therefore to deny standing; taken together,\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fCase: 21-51083      Document: 00516406497           Page: 6     Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 21-51083\n\n\n   petitioner\u2019s claim of injury seems but a shadow in the mist.\u201d (quotation\n   omitted)).\n          Plaintiffs\u2019 risks of complications from COVID-19 likewise do not\n   satisfy Article III. Here too, plaintiffs lack evidence sufficient to show this\n   \u201callegation of future injury\u201d is \u201ccertainly impending\u201d as a result of GA-38.\n   Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014); see also Whitmore\n   v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990) (\u201c[W]e have said many times before\n   and reiterate today: Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the\n   requirements of Art. III. A threatened injury must be certainly impending to\n   constitute injury in fact.\u201d (quotation omitted)); Shrimpers, 968 F.3d at 424\n   (\u201c[E]ven if a petitioner\u2019s increased-risk harms are particularized, they also\n   must be actual or imminent.\u201d). In light of widely available vaccines and the\n   schools\u2019 other mitigation efforts, \u201cthe odds\u201d of any particular plaintiff\n   contracting COVID-19 and subsequently suffering complications are\n   \u201cspeculative,\u201d and \u201cthe time (if ever) when any such [infection] would occur\n   is entirely uncertain.\u201d Pub. Citizen, 489 F.3d at 1293\u201394.\n          To be sure, \u201cimminence\u201d is \u201ca somewhat elastic concept.\u201d Lujan,\n   504 U.S. at 564 n.2; see also Ghedi v. Mayorkas, 16 F.4th 456, 465 n.36 (5th\n   Cir. 2021) (describing \u201cimminence\u201d as \u201can elastic concept that turns on a\n   sufficiently high degree of likelihood of future injury\u201d (quotation omitted)).\n   But the concept \u201ccannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure\n   that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes\u2014that the\n   injury is certainly impending.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2 (quotation\n   omitted). And it \u201chas been stretched beyond the breaking point where, as\n   here, the plaintiff alleges only an injury at some indefinite future time.\u201d Ibid.;\n   see also Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 415 (2013) (rejecting\n   standing based on \u201cfears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly\n   impending\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fCase: 21-51083      Document: 00516406497               Page: 7   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 21-51083\n\n\n          Even the district court, which entered a permanent injunction against\n   enforcement of the Executive Order, could not say that GA-38 creates a\n   \u201ccertainly impending harm or substantial risk of harm\u201d to plaintiffs.\n   Shrimpers, 968 F.3d at 424. Instead, the district court excused plaintiffs from\n   showing such proof. In the district court\u2019s words, plaintiffs need not show\n   \u201cenforcement of GA-38 will actually cause any of them to contract COVID\n   or that they would actually contract COVID in a mask-optional school\n   environment.\u201d That conclusion is remarkable, and it squarely conflicts with\n   the precedents described above.\n                                             2.\n          Perhaps     recognizing     that        the   increased-risk   claims   face\n   insurmountable roadblocks, both the district court and plaintiffs attempted\n   to reframe the relevant injury. The district court, for example, characterized\n   the injury as \u201cthe deprivation of reasonable access to in-person schooling.\u201d On\n   appeal, plaintiffs argue they are injured by \u201cdeprivation of access to in-person\n   schooling on an equal basis with their non-disabled peers.\u201d And they contend\n   the \u201ccore\u201d of their claimed equal-access injury is \u201cdenial of case-by-case\n   decisionmaking.\u201d The dissent adopts this characterization. See post, at 5\n   (characterizing plaintiffs\u2019 injury as being denied \u201can opportunity to\n   participate in public education . . . that is equal to that enjoyed by students\n   without disabilities\u201d).\n          There are at least four problems with this approach. First, arguments\n   in favor of jurisdiction can be forfeited. Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 937 F.3d\n   at 542. At successive stages of this litigation, plaintiffs have changed their\n   standing theory from \u201cincreased risk\u201d to \u201creasonable access\u201d to \u201cequal\n   access.\u201d The forfeiture rules\u2014which apply to arguments in favor of standing\n   as they do to other arguments in federal litigation, see ibid.\u2014prohibit such\n   efforts to move the goalposts.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fCase: 21-51083         Document: 00516406497           Page: 8   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 21-51083\n\n\n           Second, federal courts must consider plaintiffs\u2019 actual injury\u2014not the\n   labels plaintiffs put on that injury. As the leading treatise observes, the law of\n   standing is fraught with the danger that plaintiffs will engage in \u201cartful\n   pleading\u201d to make an end-run around the strictures of Article III. See R.\n   Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer & D. Shapiro, Hart and\n   Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System\n   124\u201325 (7th ed. 2015); Clapper, 568 U.S. at 401 (expressing concerns about\n   attempts to \u201cmanufacture standing\u201d where injuries are otherwise too\n   speculative to satisfy Article III); see also Cass R. Sunstein, Standing and the\n   Privatization of Public Law, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1432, 1464\u201365 (1988)\n   (\u201cThe     central     problem . . . is   how   to    characterize   the   relevant\n   injury . . . . [Once] recharacterized, [otherwise-speculative] injuries are not\n   speculative at all.\u201d).\n           Third, plaintiffs misunderstand the relevant legal question. What\n   matters for Article III is whether plaintiffs \u201csuffered an invasion of a legally\n   protected interest.\u201d Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339 (emphasis added) (quotation\n   omitted). Neither the ADA nor Section 504 creates a legally protected\n   interest in equality simpliciter. Rather, those statutes legally protect reasonable\n   access to covered facilities and benefits. And they require covered entities to\n   facilitate such access by way of reasonable accommodations. So ADA\n   plaintiffs aren\u2019t necessarily injured every time their method of access differs\n   from that of their non-disabled peers\u2014they\u2019re injured when they are denied\n   the reasonable access the statutes protect.\n           It\u2019s no answer to say, as plaintiffs do, that they prefer one\n   accommodation to all others. It\u2019s well settled that defendants\u2014not\n   plaintiffs\u2014get to choose between reasonable accommodation(s), and\n   plaintiffs\u2019 preferences between reasonable accommodation(s) are irrelevant.\n   See, e.g., Cadena v. El Paso Cnty., 946 F.3d 717, 725 (5th Cir. 2020) (\u201c[An\n   ADA defendant] is not required to acquiesce to [a plaintiff\u2019s] choice of\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fCase: 21-51083         Document: 00516406497               Page: 9       Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 21-51083\n\n\n   accommodations . . . . But it is required to provide her with reasonable\n   accommodations that give meaningful access to the benefit.\u201d (quotation\n   omitted)). Take, for example, plaintiffs\u2019 analogy to \u201ca student who must rely\n   on a wheelchair.\u201d In that situation, the school might accommodate the\n   student in a number of ways: it might install a lift, a ramp, or something else.\n   It can choose any reasonable one. The fact that a particular student prefers a\n   lift to a ramp is irrelevant, so long as the school picks a reasonable\n   accommodation that provides meaningful access.\n           So too here. All agree that plaintiffs have a legally protected interest\n   in reasonable access to their schools. And the schools, in turn, have numerous\n   alternatives for mitigating the risks of COVID-19 so plaintiffs have such\n   access. The schools can adopt policies regarding vaccines, plexiglass, hand\n   sanitizer, social distancing, and more. Plaintiffs have not even attempted to\n   show that one or any combination of these accommodations is insufficient to\n   mitigate the risks of COVID-19 to a level low enough that plaintiffs can attend\n   school. They have simply said that they prefer one accommodation\u2014\n   masks\u2014to all others. Therefore, they cannot show that they have suffered an\n   invasion of the legal interest the relevant statutes protect. 1\n           Fourth, there\u2019s no basis for plaintiffs\u2019 claim that GA-38 denies them\n   something the ADA guarantees\u2014namely, the right to \u201cindividualized\u201d or\n   \u201ccase-by-case decisionmaking.\u201d It\u2019s true that the ADA entitles disabled\n   students who inform their school of a disability to an \u201cindividualized\n   assessment\u201d of their needs. It\u2019s also irrelevant because the record contains\n   no evidence that any of these plaintiffs ever requested an accommodation\n   from anyone. See Windham v. Harris Cnty., 875 F.3d 229, 236\u201337 (5th Cir.\n\n\n           1\n             To the extent holding plaintiffs to their jurisdictional burden implicates the merits\n   of their ADA claims, the merits are relevant only insofar as they are \u201cintertwined\u201d with\n   plaintiffs\u2019 theory of injury. See Brownback v. King, 141 S. Ct. 740, 749 (2021).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fCase: 21-51083     Document: 00516406497            Page: 10   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 21-51083\n\n\n   2017) (\u201c[B]ecause the ADA does not require clairvoyance, the burden falls\n   on the plaintiff . . . to request an accommodation in direct and specific\n   terms.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Moreover, the record supplies no reason to\n   think any student would be denied such case-by-case determinations if\n   plaintiffs in fact requested them. Nor does GA-38 in any way prevent case-\n   by-case decisionmaking. It simply eliminates one option\u2014a mask mandate\u2014\n   and retains all others. It is plainly within the State\u2019s power to remove one\n   possible accommodation from consideration, so long as other reasonable\n   options remain. And it is transparently wrong to equate the State\u2019s course of\n   action with \u201c[d]enying the children individualized assessment of their\n   needs.\u201d\n          Here, all agree plaintiffs have physical access to their classrooms. All\n   agree all seven schools take a multi-pronged approach to COVID-19\n   mitigation. All agree plaintiffs, their classmates, and their teachers are\n   welcome to wear masks and ask those around them to wear masks. All agree\n   plaintiffs presented zero evidence that anyone\u2014let alone \u201cindividual[s]\n   working constantly with a disabled child,\u201d post, at 1 n.1\u2014would refuse a\n   request to wear a mask or take comparable safety measures while working\n   closely with a vulnerable student. And all agree at least some of the plaintiffs\n   are committed to attending in-person classes, whether or not their schools\n   mandate masks. Therefore, even if plaintiffs could recharacterize their injury\n   as denial of reasonable access to schools, plaintiffs failed to show they have\n   suffered or certainly will suffer such an injury.\n                                          B.\n          Even if plaintiffs could show injury in fact, they could not carry their\n   burden to establish traceability. Article III requires them to show \u201ca causal\n   connection between the injury and the conduct complained of\u2014the injury\n   has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fCase: 21-51083         Document: 00516406497                Page: 11        Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                            No. 21-51083\n\n\n   the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d\n   Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (quotation omitted); see also Ctr. for Biological\n   Diversity, 937 F.3d at 542. So plaintiffs must show a causal connection\n   between the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement of GA-38 (the challenged\n   action) and their increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and suffering\n   complications (their asserted injury). 2\n           Where a suit challenges a government action regulating someone other\n   than plaintiffs themselves, it is \u201cordinarily substantially more difficult\u201d to\n   establish the needed causal connection. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (quotation\n   omitted). That\u2019s because when the \u201casserted injury arises from the\n   government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regulation . . . of someone else,\u201d causation\n   will \u201cordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third\n   party . . . and perhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d Ibid. That makes it\n   plaintiffs\u2019 burden to show\u2014with the same \u201cmanner and degree of evidence\n   required at the successive stages of the litigation\u201d\u2014that those regulated\n   third parties\u2019 \u201cchoices have been or will be made in such a manner as to\n   produce causation.\u201d Id. at 561\u201362.\n\n\n\n           2\n              Plaintiffs wrongly contend that it\u2019s the Attorney General\u2019s responsibility to raise\n   traceability. \u201cAs the party invoking federal jurisdiction, the plaintiffs bear the burden of\n   demonstrating that they have standing.\u201d TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2207\n   (2021) (emphasis added). That means \u201carguments in favor of standing, like all arguments\n   in favor of jurisdiction, can be forfeited or waived.\u201d Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 937 F.3d at\n   542 (emphasis added). But the same cannot be said for arguments against jurisdiction: Our\n   court, like every federal court, \u201chas a continuing obligation to assure itself of its own\n   jurisdiction, sua sponte if necessary.\u201d Green Valley Special Utility Dist. v. City of Schertz, 969\n   F.3d 460, 468 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (quotation omitted); see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for\n   a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 93 (1998). That means even if the Attorney General had said\n   not a single word about traceability at any point in this case, we would be nonetheless\n   obligated to ensure plaintiffs have established the \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of\n   standing.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560\u201361. The dissent also misplaces the jurisdictional burden.\n   See post, at 10.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fCase: 21-51083      Document: 00516406497            Page: 12     Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                      No. 21-51083\n\n\n          This case demonstrates how heavy that burden is. Plaintiffs must\n   show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Attorney General\u2019s\n   enforcement of GA-38 caused their injury. See Env\u2019t Tex. Citizen Lobby, 968\n   F.3d at 367. But because GA-38 doesn\u2019t regulate plaintiffs\u2014it regulates the\n   school districts\u2014plaintiffs must make an additional showing. Plaintiffs must\n   show (1) the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement of GA-38 caused the school\n   districts to drop their mask mandates, and (2) plaintiffs\u2019 increased-risk\n   injuries resulted from the school districts\u2019 elimination of mask mandates. See\n   Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562; see also Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289, 298\n   (1979) (\u201cA plaintiff who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic\n   danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute\u2019s operation or\n   enforcement.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n          Plaintiffs cannot come close to that showing. On the first point, it\u2019s\n   undisputed the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement activity did not cause five of\n   the seven plaintiffs\u2019 schools to eliminate their masking requirements. As the\n   parties stipulated at the time of trial, those schools maintained their mask\n   mandates despite the Governor\u2019s issuance of GA-38, despite receiving\n   \u201cthreatening letter[s]\u201d from the Attorney General, and despite the Attorney\n   General actually suing some school districts. So at least with respect to five\n   of the plaintiffs\u2019 schools, plaintiffs cannot establish the first link in the causal\n   chain: Their school districts refused to eliminate mask mandates, regardless\n   of what the Attorney General said or did.\n          But even if the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement of GA-38 caused\n   plaintiffs\u2019 schools not to mandate masks, plaintiffs still could not trace their\n   increased-risk injuries back to the Executive Order. As discussed in Part II.A,\n   supra, plaintiffs failed to identify any increased risk of contracting COVID-19\n   resulting from the prohibition on mask mandates, and any increased risk of\n   suffering complications from a hypothetical COVID-19 infection is even\n   more attenuated. But even assuming plaintiffs could show those increased\n\n\n\n                                           12\n\fCase: 21-51083        Document: 00516406497                Page: 13        Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 21-51083\n\n\n   risks, they could be attributed to any number of variables that have nothing\n   to do with mask mandates. Those include innumerable differences in the way\n   plaintiffs\u2019 schools\u2014each an independent actor\u2014have chosen to address\n   COVID-19. See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 & n.5 (holding the uncontrollable\n   actions of independent third-parties make it difficult or impossible to trace\n   plaintiffs\u2019 injuries to defendants\u2019 conduct); see also id. at 417 n.7 (\u201cTo the\n   extent that [plaintiffs\u2019 predictions about how third parties will react] are\n   based on anything other than conjecture . . . they do not establish injury that\n   is fairly traceable [to the government\u2019s action].\u201d). Plaintiffs have done\n   nothing to control those independent variables.\n           All of this presumably explains why the entirety of the district court\u2019s\n   factual finding on this point is this: \u201cthe use of masks may decrease the risk\n   of COVID infection in group settings.\u201d 3 That finding fails to support\n   plaintiffs\u2019 contention that mask mandates are the only way they can\n   adequately reduce the risks of COVID-19. It says nothing about allowing but\n   not requiring masks. It says nothing about masks\u2019 relative efficacy vis-\u00e0-vis\n   other mitigation measures. And it says nothing about school environments\n   generally or plaintiffs\u2019 schools specifically. It therefore warrants no weight.\n   See Int\u2019l Energy Ventures Mgmt., LLC v.

But neither the dissent\n   nor the plaintiffs identified factual findings other than this one, let alone multiple\n   \u201cdetailed\u201d factual findings. See Oral Arg. at 24:40\u201326:35 (responding to request to identify\n   relevant factual findings in the district court opinion, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel pointed to the\n   court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe use of masks may decrease the risk of COVID infection in group\n   settings\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fCase: 21-51083     Document: 00516406497           Page: 14   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 21-51083\n\n\n                                          C.\n           Even if plaintiffs could meet their burden on injury in fact and\n   traceability, they still would not be able to show their injuries are likely\n   redressable by a favorable decision.\n           As with traceability, when an asserted injury arises from the\n   government\u2019s regulation of someone other than the plaintiffs, \u201credressability\n   [will] ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third\n   party.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. And that makes a plaintiff\u2019s choice of\n   defendant especially important. Because if they don\u2019t sue the regulated third\n   party, they leave redressability to turn on \u201cthe unfettered choices made by\n   independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and\n   legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or predict.\u201d\n   Ibid. (quotation omitted). And whether or not they bring the regulated parties\n   before the court, plaintiffs\u2019 redressability burden remains the same: They\n   must at least show that the regulated parties \u201cwill likely react in predictable\n   ways.\u201d California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2117 (2021) (quotation omitted).\n   \u201cPlaintiffs cannot rely on speculation\u201d about the choices the regulated\n   parties might make. Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n   562).\n           Here, plaintiffs rely wholly on speculation about the unfettered\n   choices made by actors not before our court. Plaintiffs chose not to sue their\n   school districts. The school districts have the unfettered choice\u2014with or\n   without GA-38, and with or without any involvement by the Attorney\n   General\u2014to drop their mask mandates at any time. And indeed they have.\n   None of plaintiffs\u2019 schools require masks today. And we could not enjoin\n   those schools to impose mask mandates if we wanted to because plaintiffs did\n   not sue them. That alone proves that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not redressable.\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fCase: 21-51083       Document: 00516406497              Page: 15       Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                         No. 21-51083\n\n\n           Plaintiffs chose instead to sue the Attorney General. And what does\n   the Attorney General have to do with plaintiffs\u2019 increased risks from\n   COVID-19? Nothing. He does not set masking policies. Nor can he order the\n   school districts to adopt masking policies (as evidenced by several schools\u2019\n   refusals to abide by GA-38 or the Attorney General\u2019s threatened\n   enforcement of it). And even if we affirmed the district court\u2019s permanent\n   injunction against the Attorney General, the school districts could drop (and\n   as noted above, have dropped) their mask mandates anyway. That would\n   expose plaintiffs to the exact same risks they otherwise impute to GA-38, and\n   no amount of equitable relief against the Attorney General will redress\n   anything.\n           Plaintiffs effectively concede this point by arguing not that an\n   injunction against the Attorney General would redress their injuries, but\n   rather that an injunction would \u201cclear[] the way\u201d to allow third parties\n   (namely, their schools) to redress their injuries. 4 But that\u2019s not how\n   redressability works. For example, in Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405 (5th\n   Cir. 2001) (en banc), abortionists sought a declaration that a provision of\n   Louisiana law was unconstitutional because it authorized private suits in\n   violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. We held that plaintiffs\u2019 purported\n   injuries could not be redressed by an order against defendants\u2014the\n   Governor and the Attorney General\u2014who had no power over the third\n   parties who might bring suits. See id. at 426\u201327. It was irrelevant there, as\n   here, that an order in plaintiffs\u2019 favor might clear the way for them to\n   vindicate their rights against non-parties. See id. at 453 (Parker, J.,\n   dissenting).\n\n\n\n           4\n             At trial, plaintiffs argued that \u201cbut for GA-38, these seven schools would have a\n   universal mask mandate.\u201d Plaintiffs have not made that argument on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\fCase: 21-51083      Document: 00516406497                Page: 16   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                          No. 21-51083\n\n\n          It is no answer to say, as plaintiffs do, that a permanent injunction\n   against the Attorney General partially redresses their injuries and hence\n   satisfies the Article III minimum. It\u2019s true that a partial remedy is\n   constitutionally sufficient. See Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 141 S. Ct. 792, 801\n   (2021) (recognizing nominal damages as sufficient to satisfy redressability\n   requirement despite not providing \u201cfull redress\u201d). It\u2019s also irrelevant here.\n   Even with the district court\u2019s robust injunction against the Attorney General,\n   all seven of the plaintiffs\u2019 schools could\u2014and in fact did\u2014eliminate their\n   mask mandates. Thus the injunction is not a partial remedy of their alleged\n   injuries; it\u2019s no remedy at all.\n                                      *        *         *\n          Finally, a word about the scope of plaintiffs\u2019 theory of injury and the\n   limitlessness of the dissent. According to plaintiffs and our esteemed\n   colleague in dissent, Article III of the Constitution gives plaintiffs standing to\n   demand court-created mask-mandate bubbles. This case involves schools.\n   But plaintiffs\u2019 theory, shared by the dissent, would reach every property\n   covered by the ADA and Section 504. Restaurants, movie theaters, libraries,\n   hotels, grocery stores, you name it. It would require federal courts to enforce\n   mobile mask mandates that go where plaintiffs go and require everyone\n   around them to wear masks.\n          That theory of standing is equal parts sweeping and unprecedented.\n   Today we reject it. The district court\u2019s injunction is VACATED, and the\n   case is REMANDED with instructions to DISMISS the case for lack of\n   jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fCase: 21-51083        Document: 00516406497                Page: 17     Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                          No. 21-51083\n\n\n   W.

The injunction issued by the district\n   court does not require the school districts to impose a mask mandate; it\n   simply gives them the power to do so if they find plaintiffs (or any of them)\n   are unable to attend in-school classes without even a limited mask mandate. 1\n   Based on GA-38 and Paxton\u2019s enforcement of it, plaintiffs contend that they\n   are effectively excluded from in-school classes because of their disabilities\n   and the dire consequences they face if they contract COVID-19. More\n   specifically, based on unchallenged evidence, they established that without\n   some type of mask mandate, they cannot attend classes during the pandemic,\n   and they are unfairly deprived of the valuable benefit of attending school, in\n   violation of Section 504 and the ADA. Because the district court found\n   uncontradicted evidence that the defendant\u2019s enforcement of GA-38 was the\n   only impediment to a school district\u2019s granting a modification required by\n   Section 504 and Title II to allow plaintiffs to attend school safely, the\n   injunction was appropriate.\n\n\n\n           1\n             To be clear, the sweeping order prevents the school districts from granting a\n   modification, for example, to require an individual working constantly with a disabled child\n   to wear a mask. Similarly, a mask mandate limited to staff members working in one room\n   or wing of the school with disabled children would violate GA-38.\n\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fCase: 21-51083     Document: 00516406497           Page: 18   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 21-51083\n\n\n          The majority found plaintiffs had no standing based in part on their\n   erroneous assumption that plaintiffs had brought a simple \u201cfear of COVID-\n   19\u201d case rather than the disability discrimination case that they pled and\n   tried. In my view, plaintiffs proved each element of standing, and I strongly\n   disagree with the majority\u2019s contrary conclusion. Further, I conclude that\n   the district court correctly issued the injunction against the defendant\u2019s\n   enforcement of GA-38.\n                                         I.\n          Plaintiffs-appellees, E.T., J.R., S.P., M.P., E.S., H.M., and A.M., are\n   children with disabilities who attend public schools in Texas. The children\u2019s\n   disabilities include Down syndrome, asthma, hypogammaglobulinemia, CD\n   19 deficiency, growth hormone deficiency, attention deficit hyperactivity\n   disorder, bronchiectasis, spina bifida, epilepsy, heart defects, and cerebral\n   palsy. Because of their disabilities and based on the testimony of their\n   personal physicians, the district court found that because of their heightened\n   susceptibility of contracting COVID-19 and, if contracted, a heightened risk\n   of severe illness or death from it, the children could not safely attend school\n   where they would be in close proximity to unmasked students or staff\n   members.\n          On July 29, 2021, Texas Governor Greg Abbot issued GA-38, which\n   bars any state entity, including school districts, from requiring that any\n   individual wear a mask. After Governor Abbott issued GA-38, Paxton\n   undertook a campaign against Texas\u2019s independent school districts\n   (\u201cISDs\u201d) threatening to enforce the Order. His office sent at least 98 letters\n   to different ISDs, filed 15 separate lawsuits, and made public statements on\n   Twitter expressing his willingness to continue litigating against non-\n   compliant ISDs. Further, under Paxton\u2019s instructions, the Texas Education\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fCase: 21-51083         Document: 00516406497              Page: 19   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 21-51083\n\n\n   Authority (\u201cTEA\u201d), maintained a public list of non-compliant ISDs on its\n   website.\n          Plaintiffs filed a complaint in district court on August 17, 2021. They\n   alleged that GA-38 prevents school districts from imposing mask mandates\n   as a reasonable modification for plaintiffs and other students with disabilities\n   who are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and suffering severe illness\n   or death as a result of the disease. They asserted disability discrimination\n   claims under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA. Plaintiffs\n   contend that Paxton directly discriminated against them on the basis of their\n   disabilities, and\/or indirectly caused their ISDs to discriminate against them\n   on the basis of their disabilities. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive\n   relief to bar Paxton\u2019s enforcement of GA-38.\n          After a bench trial, the district court concluded, as relevant here, that\n   GA-38 is preempted \u201cto the extent that it interferes with local school\n   districts\u2019 ability to satisfy their obligations under the ADA and Section 504\n   and their implementing regulations.\u201d The court recognized that the ADA\n   and Section 504 impose \u201can affirmative obligation [on public entities] to\n   make reasonable modifications in their policies, practices, or procedures\n   when necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless they\n   can show that so doing would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,\n   program, or activity.\u201d 2 The court found that GA-38 prohibits the use of mask\n   mandates, including targeted and limited ones, even when a school district\n   determines that \u201crequiring masks is a reasonable modification necessary to\n   enable a student with disabilities to have equal access to a safe, integrated, in-\n   person learning environment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n          2\n              See 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(7)(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fCase: 21-51083     Document: 00516406497            Page: 20   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 21-51083\n\n\n          Accordingly, the district court concluded that \u201cto the extent that\n   school districts cannot comply with GA-38\u2019s ban on mask requirements and\n   at the same time meet their obligations under the ADA and Section 504, the\n   ADA and Section 504 supersede any conflicting provisions of GA-38.\u201d To\n   that end, the court issued a final judgment declaring, in relevant part, that\n   GA-38\u2019s ban on mask mandates as applied to school districts is preempted by\n   Title II and Section 504, and enjoining Paxton and his office from enforcing\n   GA-38 as applied to school districts.\n                                           II.\n          At the outset, I emphasize that this case was tried to the bench, and\n   the district court, based on essentially uncontradicted evidence, entered\n   detailed findings of fact. The plaintiffs produced evidence from their\n   personal physicians attesting to plaintiffs\u2019 severe disabilities and giving their\n   strong opinions that, because of their disabilities, they should not attend\n   classes where students and staff they were near were not wearing masks.\n   They testified that when the action was filed and tried, the plaintiffs were not\n   eligible for vaccinations against COVID-19 and that in any event no option\n   except requiring staff and students in contact with them to wear masks would\n   give plaintiffs adequate protection from COVID-19 given the dire\n   consequences plaintiffs could suffer. Plaintiffs also produced evidence that\n   the schools they attended had mask mandates in place until GA-38 was\n   issued, and the defendant began aggressively threatening the ISDs with\n   lawsuits and fines if they required students and staff to wear masks.\n          The majority holds that plaintiffs failed to establish standing. Judge\n   Oldham, the writing judge, concluded that plaintiffs established none of the\n   elements of standing: injury, traceability, and redressability. Judge Willett\n   agreed their injury is not redressable; in effect, finding that plaintiffs should\n\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fCase: 21-51083         Document: 00516406497                 Page: 21   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 21-51083\n\n\n   have sued the ISDs, not Paxton. In my view, plaintiffs alleged and proved\n   each element of standing.\n                                                A.\n          As an initial matter, the writing judge mischaracterized plaintiffs\u2019\n   claimed injury as an \u201cincreased risk of contracting COVID-19.\u201d 3 This\n   characterization of plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injury ignores the claim alleged and\n   tried: that Paxton\u2019s conduct caused disability discrimination. Plaintiffs\u2019\n   theory has always been that Paxton\u2019s enforcement of GA-38 qualifies as\n   disability discrimination that is prohibited by the ADA and RA.\n          Plaintiffs proved that they have been, or imminently will be, injured\n   by GA-38\u2019s ban of mask requirements, because that ban denies them an\n   opportunity to participate in public education\u2014in which they have a legally\n   protected interest 4\u2014that is equal to that enjoyed by students without\n   disabilities. While all students bear some health risks by attending school in\n   person during the ongoing pandemic, the district court found, and it is\n   undisputed, that these plaintiffs face a much higher risk to their health\n   because of their disabilities. Plaintiffs presented evidence that they each\n   require mask mandates to remain safe while they are indoors, and defendant\n   neither challenged that evidence nor offered credible evidence of another\n   effective option that would protect them. 5 Despite this, defendant is\n   aggressively enforcing GA-38, which forbids school districts from requiring\n   masks as a reasonable modification\u2014no matter the circumstances\u2014and\n\n\n          3\n             To support his conclusion that this is a \u201cfear of COVID-19\u201d case, the writing\n   judge relies on Shrimpers & Fishermen of RGV v. Texas Comm\u2019n on Env\u2019t Quality, 968 F.3d\n   419, 424 (5th Cir. 2020) (per curiam).\n          4\n              See Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 574 (1975).\n          5\n             The only evidence the defendant offered was a mass of raw data showing COVID-\n   19 positivity rates in Texas public schools.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fCase: 21-51083        Document: 00516406497               Page: 22        Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 21-51083\n\n\n   instead relegates plaintiffs to taking their classes remotely, rather than\n   accepting a greater risk to their health and safety by going to school.\n           Two plaintiffs have already suffered this injury: both M.P. and E.S.\n   are enrolled in schools that rescinded their masking requirements in response\n   to GA-38, although at time of filing their ISDs had not rescinded their mask\n   mandates. The remaining five plaintiffs\u2019 injuries were imminent. Their\n   injuries were \u201ccertainly impending\u201d\u2014 that is, that there was a \u201csubstantial\n   risk that the harm [would] occur.\u201d 6 And although several of plaintiffs\u2019 school\n   districts had mask mandates in place at the time of trial, they were vulnerable\n   to the sting of civil sanctions defendant threatened them with. 7 Plaintiffs have\n   sufficiently demonstrated a substantial risk of injury.\n           All these vulnerable students are suffering (or are at substantial risk of\n   suffering) an injury sufficient to confer standing: if they choose in-person\n   school, they are compelled to accept a far higher risk to their health than is\n   required of students without disabilities. 8 These students need not prove that\n   access to school is impossible; it is enough that GA-38 removes the tool that\n\n\n\n\n           6\n            Susan B.

The Supreme Court has instructed that, to\n   determine whether an injury is concrete, courts must ask whether the asserted injury has\n   \u201ca close relationship to a harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in\n   American courts.\u201d TransUnion LLC v.

And, this injury could not be more\n   personal\u2014it prevents each plaintiff from attending school with their classmates, a\n   recognized harm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fCase: 21-51083           Document: 00516406497               Page: 23      Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                              No. 21-51083\n\n\n   the record shows would afford them an opportunity to participate in in-\n   person schooling equal to that enjoyed by students without disabilities. 9\n           In short, plaintiffs have satisfied Article III\u2019s injury requirement. The\n   discriminatory denial of equal access to education is a concrete harm, is\n   particularized to each plaintiff, and has actually materialized.\n                                                    B.\n           Paxton did not challenge traceability in his brief to this Court, for good\n   reason; plaintiffs clearly established traceability. Under this element,\n   plaintiffs must show \u201ca causal connection between the injury and the\n   conduct complained of\u2014the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged\n   action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some\n   third party not before the court.\u201d 10 But Article III requires only \u201cde facto\n   causation.\u201d 11\n           At trial, plaintiffs introduced uncontroverted evidence that\n   establishes traceability for at least one plaintiff, which is all that is required\n   for standing. 12 Specifically, M.P. attends school in Fort Bend ISD\n   (\u201cFBISD\u201d), which dropped its mask mandate by the time trial occurred.\n   Plaintiffs submitted an affidavit by Dennetta Williams, an elected member of\n   FBISD\u2019s Board of Trustees, who attested that \u201c[t]he FBISD mask mandate\n   would remain in place but for [Paxton\u2019s] enforcement of GA-38.\u201d This\n\n\n\n           9\n                See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(1)(i)-(iii).\n           10\n                Lujan v.

Paxton, the State\u2019s highest law enforcement authority, exerted\n   extraordinary pressure on the non-compliant ISDs. As discussed, Paxton sent\n   threatening letters, made threatening tweets, and filed lawsuits against 15\n   different ISDs to enforce GA-38. The \u201cpredictable effect\u201d of Paxton\u2019s\n   enforcement activity was that ISDs would drop their mask mandates. 13\n   Indeed, as of now, none of the seven ISDs have mask mandates.\n           Based on Williams\u2019 affidavit and the predictable effect of Paxton\u2019s\n   enforcement efforts on non-compliant ISDs, I would affirm the district\n   court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs\u2019 injuries are fairly traceable to Paxton\u2019s\n   conduct.\n                                                     C.\n           To establish the final element of standing, redressability, plaintiffs\n   must show that it is \u201clikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that a favorable\n   decision will redress\u201d their injury. 14 The redressability requirement is met\n   when \u201ca favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury\u201d to the plaintiffs. 15\n   They \u201cneed not show that a favorable decision will relieve [their] every\n   injury.\u201d 16 Plaintiffs satisfied these requirements.\n\n\n           13\n                Dep\u2019t of Com., 139 S.

Also, contrary to\n   what the majority says, plaintiffs do not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d that school\n   districts will impose mask mandates if Paxton is enjoined. Instead, plaintiffs\n   submitted uncontroverted evidence establishing that at least one ISD would\n   immediately reinstate its mask mandate if Paxton is enjoined. In particular,\n   plaintiffs rely on the affidavit by Williams, who attested that \u201cif [Paxton]\n   stopped enforcing GA-38, or there is an order barring enforcement of GA-38,\n   the FBISD mask requirement would immediately go back into effect.\u201d\n           The unchallenged evidence also reflected that all the districts had\n   mask mandates in place when GA-38 issued. The defendant produced no\n   evidence that any of the school districts ever had opposition to the mask\n   mandates in place. It was only after GA-38 issued and Paxton\u2019s enforcement\n   activity began that school districts began yielding to those threats and began\n   lifting their mandates. If this Court affirms the district court\u2019s injunction and\n   holds that Section 504 and Title II required that school districts be allowed\n   to exercise their discretion as to each individual plaintiff and provide an\n   appropriate modification, it is completely predictable that the school districts\n   would comply with the law by imposing some type of mask mandate. GA-38\n   does not permit the school districts to do this. As the Supreme Court\n   explained in Department of Commerce v. New York, plaintiffs can properly rely\n   on the \u201cpredictable effect of government action on the decisions of third\n   parties\u201d as an element of their standing. 17\n           Based on this evidence, if this Court upholds the injunction against\n   Paxton (which was stayed after three weeks by a motions panel of this\n\n\n           17\n              139 S.

As a result, plaintiffs would no\n   longer face the Hobson\u2019s choice of either taking inadequate virtual classes,\n   or attending school without a mask mandate despite the medical advice of\n   their doctors.\n            The district court recognized that ISDs could refuse to impose mask\n   mandates if such mandates \u201cfundamentally alter[ed]\u201d the nature of school\n   programs. 19 But, as the district court correctly noted, Paxton \u201cfailed to\n   present any evidence that would support a claim that mask requirements\n   fundamentally alter the educational programs of local school districts.\u201d 20\n   Paxton had an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of mask\n   mandates\u2014or show the availability of other measures\u2014but he utterly failed\n   to do so. In fact, during the proceedings below, Paxton submitted a single\n   piece of evidence: a mass of raw data showing COVID-19 infection numbers\n   in Texas public schools. He did not even provide an expert opinion to assist\n   the district court or this Court in interpreting the data. Paxton\u2019s decision not\n   to produce evidence should be fatal to his arguments. Thus, on the facts\n   before this Court, federal law obligates ISDs to impose the mask mandates\n   that GA-38 forbids. It is therefore certain, not speculative, that an injunction\n   against Paxton would remedy plaintiffs\u2019 harm.\n\n\n\n\n            18\n                 See E.T. v. Paxton, 19 F.4th 760, 763 (5th Cir. 2021).\n            19\n              Under the ADA\u2019s implementing regulations, a public entity need not provide a\n   modification, even if it is \u201creasonable,\u201d when it \u201cfundamentally alters\u201d the nature of the\n   service, program, or activity. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7)(i).\n            20\n                 E.T. v.

Paxton\u2019s enforcement activity was the de facto cause of this\n   discrimination, and an injunction would remedy the injury. For these\n   reasons, I am satisfied that plaintiffs established each element of standing. 21\n                                              III.\n           As to the merits, I would affirm the district court\u2019s injunction to the\n   extent it bars Paxton\u2019s enforcement of GA-38 against plaintiffs\u2019 ISDs and\n   prevents the ISDs from granting even a limited mandate that would allow\n   plaintiffs to attend school.\n           As the district court recognized, Title II and Section 504 and their\n   implementing regulations place an \u201caffirmative obligation\u201d on public entities\n   to make reasonable modifications in their policies and practices when\n   necessary to avoid discrimination because of disability. 22 Texas school\n   districts are subject to Title II and Section 504 as public entities that receive\n\n\n\n\n           21\n              In a Rule 28(j) letter to this Court, defendants cite Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 33\n   F.4th 1042, 1044 (8th Cir. 2022), in which the Eighth Circuit found that a similar case was\n   moot because of the lessened severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as plaintiffs\n   argue in a different Rule 28(j) letter, the Center for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) continues\n   to recommend that people around vulnerable individuals, like plaintiffs, wear masks. Based\n   on the ongoing nature of the pandemic, and that the CDC continues to recommend\n   masking around vulnerable individuals, this case is not moot.\n           22\n              See Bennett-Nelson v.

An injunction \u201cshould be no more burdensome to the defendant\n   than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.\u201d 25 Plaintiffs\u2019\n   injuries would be remedied by a narrow injunction that prohibits Paxton from\n   enforcing GA-38 against the seven ISDs in which plaintiffs attend schools to\n   the extent that GA-38 bars the school districts from granting an\n   accommodation under Section 504 and Title II by requiring some form of\n   mask mandate. The injunction should be limited accordingly.\n           For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the district court\u2019s decision\n   to enjoin Paxton\u2019s enforcement of GA-38. However, because the injunction\n   is overbroad, I would vacate the injunction and remand so that the district\n   court can modify the injunction to bar Paxton from enforcing GA-38 against\n   the seven ISDs plaintiffs attend but limit it to the extent that it precludes\n   school districts the authority to grant a limited mask mandate to allow the\n\n\n\n\n           23\n                42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(1)(B); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(b)(2)(B).\n           24\n              See Mary Jo C. v.

The original complaint included 14 plaintiffs,\n   who were \u201cstudents with disabilities and underlying medical conditions\n   which carry an increased risk of serious complications or death in the event\n   that they contract COVID-19.\u201d It named as defendants Governor Abbott, the\n   TEA, and TEA Commissioner Mike Morath.\n          The original complaint included three claims: (1) violation of the\n   Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) against Abbott and Morath in\n   their official capacities, (2) violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n   of 1973 against all defendants, and (3) federal preemption under the\n   American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\u201cARP Act\u201d) against all defendants.\n   Plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief.\n          Plaintiffs amended their complaint twice before trial. First, on\n   September 1, they amended their complaint to add the Attorney General as a\n   defendant. Second, a week before trial, plaintiffs filed a second amended\n   complaint with leave of court, adding a new claim and subtracting some\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fCase: 21-51083      Document: 00516406497           Page: 3     Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 21-51083\n\n\n   plaintiffs and a defendant. The new claim alleged the ADA and\n   Rehabilitation Act preempted GA-38. Seven plaintiffs exited the suit, and the\n   seven remaining plaintiffs dropped their claims against the Governor.\n          After denying plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order and\n   preliminary injunction, the district court held a bench trial and entered a\n   permanent injunction and final judgment against the Attorney General. The\n   court held that plaintiffs have standing to sue. It then declared that GA-38\n   violates Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. It\n   further held that, insofar as it applies to school districts, GA-38 is preempted\n   by the ADA, Section 504, and the ARP Act. The court enjoined the\n   Attorney General from enforcing the Executive Order. The Attorney\n   General sought a stay pending appeal, which the district court denied.

The five schools with mask mandates measured at 0.3, 1.1, 2.3, 4.9,\n   and 5.4 percent\u2014higher, lower, and in between the rates from the mask-\n   optional schools. Moreover, plaintiffs did nothing to control for their\n   schools\u2019 various other efforts to reduce COVID-19 infections, and hence did\n   nothing to prove the relative efficacy of mask mandates in the five law-\n   violating schools.

Instead, the district court excused plaintiffs from\n   showing such proof. In the district court\u2019s words, plaintiffs need not show\n   \u201cenforcement of GA-38 will actually cause any of them to contract COVID\n   or that they would actually contract COVID in a mask-optional school\n   environment.\u201d That conclusion is remarkable, and it squarely conflicts with\n   the precedents described above.\n                                             2.\n          Perhaps     recognizing     that        the   increased-risk   claims   face\n   insurmountable roadblocks, both the district court and plaintiffs attempted\n   to reframe the relevant injury. The district court, for example, characterized\n   the injury as \u201cthe deprivation of reasonable access to in-person schooling.\u201d On\n   appeal, plaintiffs argue they are injured by \u201cdeprivation of access to in-person\n   schooling on an equal basis with their non-disabled peers.\u201d And they contend\n   the \u201ccore\u201d of their claimed equal-access injury is \u201cdenial of case-by-case\n   decisionmaking.\u201d The dissent adopts this characterization. See post, at 5\n   (characterizing plaintiffs\u2019 injury as being denied \u201can opportunity to\n   participate in public education . . . that is equal to that enjoyed by students\n   without disabilities\u201d).\n          There are at least four problems with this approach. First, arguments\n   in favor of jurisdiction can be forfeited. Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 937 F.3d\n   at 542. At successive stages of this litigation, plaintiffs have changed their\n   standing theory from \u201cincreased risk\u201d to \u201creasonable access\u201d to \u201cequal\n   access.\u201d The forfeiture rules\u2014which apply to arguments in favor of standing\n   as they do to other arguments in federal litigation, see ibid.\u2014prohibit such\n   efforts to move the goalposts.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fCase: 21-51083         Document: 00516406497           Page: 8   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 21-51083\n\n\n           Second, federal courts must consider plaintiffs\u2019 actual injury\u2014not the\n   labels plaintiffs put on that injury. As the leading treatise observes, the law of\n   standing is fraught with the danger that plaintiffs will engage in \u201cartful\n   pleading\u201d to make an end-run around the strictures of Article III.

Neither the ADA nor Section 504 creates a legally protected\n   interest in equality simpliciter. Rather, those statutes legally protect reasonable\n   access to covered facilities and benefits. And they require covered entities to\n   facilitate such access by way of reasonable accommodations. So ADA\n   plaintiffs aren\u2019t necessarily injured every time their method of access differs\n   from that of their non-disabled peers\u2014they\u2019re injured when they are denied\n   the reasonable access the statutes protect.\n           It\u2019s no answer to say, as plaintiffs do, that they prefer one\n   accommodation to all others. It\u2019s well settled that defendants\u2014not\n   plaintiffs\u2014get to choose between reasonable accommodation(s), and\n   plaintiffs\u2019 preferences between reasonable accommodation(s) are irrelevant.\n   See, e.g., Cadena v. El Paso Cnty., <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">946 F.3d 717<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (5th Cir. 2020) (\u201c[An\n   ADA defendant] is not required to acquiesce to [a plaintiff\u2019s] choice of\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fCase: 21-51083         Document: 00516406497               Page: 9       Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 21-51083\n\n\n   accommodations . . . . But it is required to provide her with reasonable\n   accommodations that give meaningful access to the benefit.\u201d (quotation\n   omitted)). Take, for example, plaintiffs\u2019 analogy to \u201ca student who must rely\n   on a wheelchair.\u201d In that situation, the school might accommodate the\n   student in a number of ways: it might install a lift, a ramp, or something else.\n   It can choose any reasonable one. The fact that a particular student prefers a\n   lift to a ramp is irrelevant, so long as the school picks a reasonable\n   accommodation that provides meaningful access.\n           So too here. All agree that plaintiffs have a legally protected interest\n   in reasonable access to their schools. And the schools, in turn, have numerous\n   alternatives for mitigating the risks of COVID-19 so plaintiffs have such\n   access. The schools can adopt policies regarding vaccines, plexiglass, hand\n   sanitizer, social distancing, and more. Plaintiffs have not even attempted to\n   show that one or any combination of these accommodations is insufficient to\n   mitigate the risks of COVID-19 to a level low enough that plaintiffs can attend\n   school. They have simply said that they prefer one accommodation\u2014\n   masks\u2014to all others. Therefore, they cannot show that they have suffered an\n   invasion of the legal interest the relevant statutes protect. 1\n           Fourth, there\u2019s no basis for plaintiffs\u2019 claim that GA-38 denies them\n   something the ADA guarantees\u2014namely, the right to \u201cindividualized\u201d or\n   \u201ccase-by-case decisionmaking.\u201d It\u2019s true that the ADA entitles disabled\n   students who inform their school of a disability to an \u201cindividualized\n   assessment\u201d of their needs. It\u2019s also irrelevant because the record contains\n   no evidence that any of these plaintiffs ever requested an accommodation\n   from anyone. See Windham v.

Moreover, the record supplies no reason to\n   think any student would be denied such case-by-case determinations if\n   plaintiffs in fact requested them. Nor does GA-38 in any way prevent case-\n   by-case decisionmaking. It simply eliminates one option\u2014a mask mandate\u2014\n   and retains all others. It is plainly within the State\u2019s power to remove one\n   possible accommodation from consideration, so long as other reasonable\n   options remain. And it is transparently wrong to equate the State\u2019s course of\n   action with \u201c[d]enying the children individualized assessment of their\n   needs.\u201d\n          Here, all agree plaintiffs have physical access to their classrooms. All\n   agree all seven schools take a multi-pronged approach to COVID-19\n   mitigation. All agree plaintiffs, their classmates, and their teachers are\n   welcome to wear masks and ask those around them to wear masks. All agree\n   plaintiffs presented zero evidence that anyone\u2014let alone \u201cindividual[s]\n   working constantly with a disabled child,\u201d post, at 1 n.1\u2014would refuse a\n   request to wear a mask or take comparable safety measures while working\n   closely with a vulnerable student. And all agree at least some of the plaintiffs\n   are committed to attending in-person classes, whether or not their schools\n   mandate masks. Therefore, even if plaintiffs could recharacterize their injury\n   as denial of reasonable access to schools, plaintiffs failed to show they have\n   suffered or certainly will suffer such an injury.\n                                          B.\n          Even if plaintiffs could show injury in fact, they could not carry their\n   burden to establish traceability.

On the first point, it\u2019s\n   undisputed the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement activity did not cause five of\n   the seven plaintiffs\u2019 schools to eliminate their masking requirements. As the\n   parties stipulated at the time of trial, those schools maintained their mask\n   mandates despite the Governor\u2019s issuance of GA-38, despite receiving\n   \u201cthreatening letter[s]\u201d from the Attorney General, and despite the Attorney\n   General actually suing some school districts. So at least with respect to five\n   of the plaintiffs\u2019 schools, plaintiffs cannot establish the first link in the causal\n   chain: Their school districts refused to eliminate mask mandates, regardless\n   of what the Attorney General said or did.\n          But even if the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement of GA-38 caused\n   plaintiffs\u2019 schools not to mandate masks, plaintiffs still could not trace their\n   increased-risk injuries back to the Executive Order. As discussed in Part II.A,\n   supra, plaintiffs failed to identify any increased risk of contracting COVID-19\n   resulting from the prohibition on mask mandates, and any increased risk of\n   suffering complications from a hypothetical COVID-19 infection is even\n   more attenuated.

Plaintiffs chose not to sue their\n   school districts. The school districts have the unfettered choice\u2014with or\n   without GA-38, and with or without any involvement by the Attorney\n   General\u2014to drop their mask mandates at any time. And indeed they have.\n   None of plaintiffs\u2019 schools require masks today. And we could not enjoin\n   those schools to impose mask mandates if we wanted to because plaintiffs did\n   not sue them. That alone proves that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not redressable.\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fCase: 21-51083       Document: 00516406497              Page: 15       Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                         No. 21-51083\n\n\n           Plaintiffs chose instead to sue the Attorney General. And what does\n   the Attorney General have to do with plaintiffs\u2019 increased risks from\n   COVID-19? Nothing. He does not set masking policies. Nor can he order the\n   school districts to adopt masking policies (as evidenced by several schools\u2019\n   refusals to abide by GA-38 or the Attorney General\u2019s threatened\n   enforcement of it). And even if we affirmed the district court\u2019s permanent\n   injunction against the Attorney General, the school districts could drop (and\n   as noted above, have dropped) their mask mandates anyway. That would\n   expose plaintiffs to the exact same risks they otherwise impute to GA-38, and\n   no amount of equitable relief against the Attorney General will redress\n   anything.\n           Plaintiffs effectively concede this point by arguing not that an\n   injunction against the Attorney General would redress their injuries, but\n   rather that an injunction would \u201cclear[] the way\u201d to allow third parties\n   (namely, their schools) to redress their injuries. 4 But that\u2019s not how\n   redressability works.

This case involves schools.\n   But plaintiffs\u2019 theory, shared by the dissent, would reach every property\n   covered by the ADA and Section 504. Restaurants, movie theaters, libraries,\n   hotels, grocery stores, you name it.

Eugene Davis, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n           The parents of seven severely disabled children, highly susceptible to\n   contracting      COVID-19,          brought      this     straightforward        disability\n   discrimination lawsuit against defendant-appellant, Texas Attorney General\n   Kenneth Paxton (\u201cPaxton\u201d). They sought to enjoin Paxton\u2019s aggressive\n   enforcement of Executive Order GA-38 which on its face prohibited the\n   school districts from imposing even a limited mask mandate as an\n   accommodation under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\u201cRA\u201d or\n   \u201cSection 504\u201d) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d\n   or \u201cTitle II\u201d) to protect these children. The injunction issued by the district\n   court does not require the school districts to impose a mask mandate; it\n   simply gives them the power to do so if they find plaintiffs (or any of them)\n   are unable to attend in-school classes without even a limited mask mandate. 1\n   Based on GA-38 and Paxton\u2019s enforcement of it, plaintiffs contend that they\n   are effectively excluded from in-school classes because of their disabilities\n   and the dire consequences they face if they contract COVID-19. More\n   specifically, based on unchallenged evidence, they established that without\n   some type of mask mandate, they cannot attend classes during the pandemic,\n   and they are unfairly deprived of the valuable benefit of attending school, in\n   violation of Section 504 and the ADA. Because the district court found\n   uncontradicted evidence that the defendant\u2019s enforcement of GA-38 was the\n   only impediment to a school district\u2019s granting a modification required by\n   Section 504 and Title II to allow plaintiffs to attend school safely, the\n   injunction was appropriate.\n\n\n\n           1\n             To be clear, the sweeping order prevents the school districts from granting a\n   modification, for example, to require an individual working constantly with a disabled child\n   to wear a mask. Similarly, a mask mandate limited to staff members working in one room\n   or wing of the school with disabled children would violate GA-38.\n\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fCase: 21-51083     Document: 00516406497           Page: 18   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 21-51083\n\n\n          The majority found plaintiffs had no standing based in part on their\n   erroneous assumption that plaintiffs had brought a simple \u201cfear of COVID-\n   19\u201d case rather than the disability discrimination case that they pled and\n   tried. In my view, plaintiffs proved each element of standing, and I strongly\n   disagree with the majority\u2019s contrary conclusion. Further, I conclude that\n   the district court correctly issued the injunction against the defendant\u2019s\n   enforcement of GA-38.\n                                         I.\n          Plaintiffs-appellees, E.T., J.R., S.P., M.P., E.S., H.M., and A.M., are\n   children with disabilities who attend public schools in Texas. The children\u2019s\n   disabilities include Down syndrome, asthma, hypogammaglobulinemia, CD\n   19 deficiency, growth hormone deficiency, attention deficit hyperactivity\n   disorder, bronchiectasis, spina bifida, epilepsy, heart defects, and cerebral\n   palsy. Because of their disabilities and based on the testimony of their\n   personal physicians, the district court found that because of their heightened\n   susceptibility of contracting COVID-19 and, if contracted, a heightened risk\n   of severe illness or death from it, the children could not safely attend school\n   where they would be in close proximity to unmasked students or staff\n   members.\n          On July 29, 2021, Texas Governor Greg Abbot issued GA-38, which\n   bars any state entity, including school districts, from requiring that any\n   individual wear a mask. After Governor Abbott issued GA-38, Paxton\n   undertook a campaign against Texas\u2019s independent school districts\n   (\u201cISDs\u201d) threatening to enforce the Order. His office sent at least 98 letters\n   to different ISDs, filed 15 separate lawsuits, and made public statements on\n   Twitter expressing his willingness to continue litigating against non-\n   compliant ISDs. Further, under Paxton\u2019s instructions, the Texas Education\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fCase: 21-51083         Document: 00516406497              Page: 19   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 21-51083\n\n\n   Authority (\u201cTEA\u201d), maintained a public list of non-compliant ISDs on its\n   website.\n          Plaintiffs filed a complaint in district court on August 17, 2021. They\n   alleged that GA-38 prevents school districts from imposing mask mandates\n   as a reasonable modification for plaintiffs and other students with disabilities\n   who are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and suffering severe illness\n   or death as a result of the disease. They asserted disability discrimination\n   claims under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA. Plaintiffs\n   contend that Paxton directly discriminated against them on the basis of their\n   disabilities, and\/or indirectly caused their ISDs to discriminate against them\n   on the basis of their disabilities. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive\n   relief to bar Paxton\u2019s enforcement of GA-38.\n          After a bench trial, the district court concluded, as relevant here, that\n   GA-38 is preempted \u201cto the extent that it interferes with local school\n   districts\u2019 ability to satisfy their obligations under the ADA and Section 504\n   and their implementing regulations.\u201d The court recognized that the ADA\n   and Section 504 impose \u201can affirmative obligation [on public entities] to\n   make reasonable modifications in their policies, practices, or procedures\n   when necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless they\n   can show that so doing would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,\n   program, or activity.\u201d 2 The court found that GA-38 prohibits the use of mask\n   mandates, including targeted and limited ones, even when a school district\n   determines that \u201crequiring masks is a reasonable modification necessary to\n   enable a student with disabilities to have equal access to a safe, integrated, in-\n   person learning environment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n          2\n              See 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(7)(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fCase: 21-51083     Document: 00516406497            Page: 20   Date Filed: 07\/25\/2022\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 21-51083\n\n\n          Accordingly, the district court concluded that \u201cto the extent that\n   school districts cannot comply with GA-38\u2019s ban on mask requirements and\n   at the same time meet their obligations under the ADA and Section 504, the\n   ADA and Section 504 supersede any conflicting provisions of GA-38.\u201d To\n   that end, the court issued a final judgment declaring, in relevant part, that\n   GA-38\u2019s ban on mask mandates as applied to school districts is preempted by\n   Title II and Section 504, and enjoining Paxton and his office from enforcing\n   GA-38 as applied to school districts.\n                                           II.\n          At the outset, I emphasize that this case was tried to the bench, and\n   the district court, based on essentially uncontradicted evidence, entered\n   detailed findings of fact. The plaintiffs produced evidence from their\n   personal physicians attesting to plaintiffs\u2019 severe disabilities and giving their\n   strong opinions that, because of their disabilities, they should not attend\n   classes where students and staff they were near were not wearing masks.\n   They testified that when the action was filed and tried, the plaintiffs were not\n   eligible for vaccinations against COVID-19 and that in any event no option\n   except requiring staff and students in contact with them to wear masks would\n   give plaintiffs adequate protection from COVID-19 given the dire\n   consequences plaintiffs could suffer. Plaintiffs also produced evidence that\n   the schools they attended had mask mandates in place until GA-38 was\n   issued, and the defendant began aggressively threatening the ISDs with\n   lawsuits and fines if they required students and staff to wear masks.\n          The majority holds that plaintiffs failed to establish standing. Judge\n   Oldham, the writing judge, concluded that plaintiffs established none of the\n   elements of standing: injury, traceability, and redressability.

Plaintiffs\u2019\n   theory has always been that Paxton\u2019s enforcement of GA-38 qualifies as\n   disability discrimination that is prohibited by the ADA and RA.\n          Plaintiffs proved that they have been, or imminently will be, injured\n   by GA-38\u2019s ban of mask requirements, because that ban denies them an\n   opportunity to participate in public education\u2014in which they have a legally\n   protected interest 4\u2014that is equal to that enjoyed by students without\n   disabilities. While all students bear some health risks by attending school in\n   person during the ongoing pandemic, the district court found, and it is\n   undisputed, that these plaintiffs face a much higher risk to their health\n   because of their disabilities. Plaintiffs presented evidence that they each\n   require mask mandates to remain safe while they are indoors, and defendant\n   neither challenged that evidence nor offered credible evidence of another\n   effective option that would protect them. 5 Despite this, defendant is\n   aggressively enforcing GA-38, which forbids school districts from requiring\n   masks as a reasonable modification\u2014no matter the circumstances\u2014and\n\n\n          3\n             To support his conclusion that this is a \u201cfear of COVID-19\u201d case, the writing\n   judge relies on Shrimpers & Fishermen of RGV v.

Also, contrary to\n   what the majority says, plaintiffs do not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d that school\n   districts will impose mask mandates if Paxton is enjoined. Instead, plaintiffs\n   submitted uncontroverted evidence establishing that at least one ISD would\n   immediately reinstate its mask mandate if Paxton is enjoined. In particular,\n   plaintiffs rely on the affidavit by Williams, who attested that \u201cif [Paxton]\n   stopped enforcing GA-38, or there is an order barring enforcement of GA-38,\n   the FBISD mask requirement would immediately go back into effect.\u201d\n           The unchallenged evidence also reflected that all the districts had\n   mask mandates in place when GA-38 issued. The defendant produced no\n   evidence that any of the school districts ever had opposition to the mask\n   mandates in place. It was only after GA-38 issued and Paxton\u2019s enforcement\n   activity began that school districts began yielding to those threats and began\n   lifting their mandates. If this Court affirms the district court\u2019s injunction and\n   holds that Section 504 and Title II required that school districts be allowed\n   to exercise their discretion as to each individual plaintiff and provide an\n   appropriate modification, it is completely predictable that the school districts\n   would comply with the law by imposing some type of mask mandate. GA-38\n   does not permit the school districts to do this. As the Supreme Court\n   explained in Department of Commerce v. New York, plaintiffs can properly rely\n   on the \u201cpredictable effect of government action on the decisions of third\n   parties\u201d as an element of their standing. 17\n           Based on this evidence, if this Court upholds the injunction against\n   Paxton (which was stayed after three weeks by a motions panel of this\n\n\n           17\n              <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4410724\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/4633471\/department-of-commerce-v-new-york\/\">139 S.

As a result, plaintiffs would no\n   longer face the Hobson\u2019s choice of either taking inadequate virtual classes,\n   or attending school without a mask mandate despite the medical advice of\n   their doctors.\n            The district court recognized that ISDs could refuse to impose mask\n   mandates if such mandates \u201cfundamentally alter[ed]\u201d the nature of school\n   programs. 19 But, as the district court correctly noted, Paxton \u201cfailed to\n   present any evidence that would support a claim that mask requirements\n   fundamentally alter the educational programs of local school districts.\u201d 20\n   Paxton had an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of mask\n   mandates\u2014or show the availability of other measures\u2014but he utterly failed\n   to do so. In fact, during the proceedings below, Paxton submitted a single\n   piece of evidence: a mass of raw data showing COVID-19 infection numbers\n   in Texas public schools. He did not even provide an expert opinion to assist\n   the district court or this Court in interpreting the data. Paxton\u2019s decision not\n   to produce evidence should be fatal to his arguments. Thus, on the facts\n   before this Court, federal law obligates ISDs to impose the mask mandates\n   that GA-38 forbids.

See Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 161.001. After a bench trial, the trial court rendered\n\njudgment finding by clear and convincing evidence that several statutory grounds existed for\n\nterminating N.S.\u2019s parental rights and that termination was in the children\u2019s best interest. See id.\n\n\u00a7 161.001(b)(1)(D), (E), (O), (N), (b)(2).\n\n               Appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel has filed a brief concluding that the appeal\n\nis frivolous and without merit. See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967); In re P.M.,\n\n520 S.W.3d 24, 27 & n.10 (Tex. 2016) (per curiam) (approving use of Anders procedure in\n\nappeals from termination of parental rights because it \u201cstrikes an important balance between\n\nthe defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel on appeal and counsel\u2019s obligation not to\n\nprosecute frivolous appeals\u201d (citations omitted)). The brief meets the requirements of Anders by\n\npresenting a professional evaluation of the record and demonstrating why there are no arguable\n\fgrounds to be advanced on appeal. See 386 U.S. at 744; Taylor v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Protective &\n\nRegulatory Servs., 160 S.W.3d 641, 646\u201347 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2005, pet. denied) (applying\n\nAnders procedure in parental-termination case). Appellant\u2019s counsel has certified to this Court\n\nthat he has provided N.S. with a copy of the Anders brief and informed her of her right to receive\n\na copy of the entire appellate record and file a pro se brief. The Department of Family and\n\nProtective Services has filed a response to the Anders brief, waiving its right to file an appellee\u2019s\n\nbrief unless requested by this Court or as needed to respond to any pro se brief filed by appellant.\n\nTo date, appellant has not filed a pro se brief.\n\n               We have conducted a full examination of all of the proceedings to determine\n\nwhether the appeal is wholly frivolous, as we must when presented with an Anders brief. See\n\nPenson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 80 (1988). We have specifically reviewed the trial court\u2019s findings\n\nas to N.S. under parts (D) and (E) of Family Code \u00a7 161.001(b)(1), and we have found no non-\n\nfrivolous issues that could be raised on appeal with respect to those findings. See In re N.G.,\n\n577 S.W.3d 230, 237 (Tex. 2019) (holding that \u201cdue process and due course of law requirements\n\nmandate that an appellate court detail its analysis for an appeal of termination of parental\n\nrights under section 161.001(b)(1)(D) or (E) of the Family Code\u201d). After reviewing the record\n\nand the Anders brief, we find nothing in the record that would arguably support N.S.\u2019s appeal.\n\nWe agree with appellant\u2019s counsel that the appeal is frivolous and without merit. Accordingly,\n\nwe affirm the trial court\u2019s order terminating the parental rights of N.S. We deny counsel\u2019s\n\nmotion to withdraw.1\n\n\n       1\n         The Texas Supreme Court has held that the right to counsel in suits seeking termination\nof parental rights extends to \u201call proceedings [in the Texas Supreme Court], including the filing\nof a petition for review.\u201d In re P.M., 520 S.W.3d 24, 27\u201328 (Tex. 2016) (per curiam).\nAccordingly, counsel\u2019s obligations to N.S. have not yet been discharged.

After a bench trial, the trial court rendered\n\njudgment finding by clear and convincing evidence that several statutory grounds existed for\n\nterminating N.S.\u2019s parental rights and that termination was in the children\u2019s best interest. See id.\n\n\u00a7 161.001(b)(1)(D), (E), (O), (N), (b)(2).\n\n               Appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel has filed a brief concluding that the appeal\n\nis frivolous and without merit. See Anders v. California, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107423\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/107423\/anders-v-california\/\">386 U.S. 738<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744 (1967); In re P.M.,\n\n<\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">520 S.W.3d 24<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 & n.10 (Tex. 2016) (per curiam) (approving use of Anders procedure in\n\nappeals from termination of parental rights because it \u201cstrikes an important balance between\n\nthe defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel on appeal and counsel\u2019s obligation not to\n\nprosecute frivolous appeals\u201d (citations omitted)). The brief meets the requirements of Anders by\n\npresenting a professional evaluation of the record and demonstrating why there are no arguable\n\fgrounds to be advanced on appeal.

App.\u2014Austin 2005, pet. denied) (applying\n\nAnders procedure in parental-termination case). Appellant\u2019s counsel has certified to this Court\n\nthat he has provided N.S. with a copy of the Anders brief and informed her of her right to receive\n\na copy of the entire appellate record and file a pro se brief. The Department of Family and\n\nProtective Services has filed a response to the Anders brief, waiving its right to file an appellee\u2019s\n\nbrief unless requested by this Court or as needed to respond to any pro se brief filed by appellant.\n\nTo date, appellant has not filed a pro se brief.\n\n               We have conducted a full examination of all of the proceedings to determine\n\nwhether the appeal is wholly frivolous, as we must when presented with an Anders brief. See\n\nPenson v. Ohio, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112157\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/112157\/penson-v-ohio\/\">488 U.S. 75<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1988). We have specifically reviewed the trial court\u2019s findings\n\nas to N.S. under parts (D) and (E) of Family Code \u00a7 161.001(b)(1), and we have found no non-\n\nfrivolous issues that could be raised on appeal with respect to those findings. See In re N.G.,\n\n<\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">577 S.W.3d 230<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237 (Tex. 2019) (holding that \u201cdue process and due course of law requirements\n\nmandate that an appellate court detail its analysis for an appeal of termination of parental\n\nrights under section 161.001(b)(1)(D) or (E) of the Family Code\u201d). After reviewing the record\n\nand the Anders brief, we find nothing in the record that would arguably support N.S.\u2019s appeal.\n\nWe agree with appellant\u2019s counsel that the appeal is frivolous and without merit. Accordingly,\n\nwe affirm the trial court\u2019s order terminating the parental rights of N.S. We deny counsel\u2019s\n\nmotion to withdraw.1\n\n\n       1\n         The Texas Supreme Court has held that the right to counsel in suits seeking termination\nof parental rights extends to \u201call proceedings [in the Texas Supreme Court], including the filing\nof a petition for review.\u201d In re P.M., <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">520 S.W.3d 24<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27\u201328 (Tex. 2016) (per curiam).\nAccordingly, counsel\u2019s obligations to N.S. have not yet been discharged.
