Kraus, J.), entered on or about February 10, 2014, affirmed, with $25 costs. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"9\" id=\"pa9\">We agree that respondent Lillian Zenker failed to meet her \"affirmative obligation\" of establishing succession rights to the rent stabilized tenancy as a nontraditional family member of the deceased tenant (<i>see<\/i> Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] \u00a7 2523.5[e]). While respondent and tenant may have lived together in a close relationship at one time, it is not disputed that the parties separated in 1988 and respondent then lived elsewhere for some 15 years. Although respondent moved back into the apartment in 2003 - because she was facing eviction from her basement apartment in Queens - there was no evidence that she thereafter resided with tenant in a relationship characterized by \"emotional and financial commitment and interdependence\" (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2523-notices-and-records\/section-25235-notice-for-renewal-of-lease-and-renewal-procedure\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR \u00a7 2523.5<\/a> [b][1]). There was neither testimony from friends, neighbors, or family members corroborating a family-type relationship between the two, nor any documentary or other credible evidence that respondent and tenant intermingled finances, jointly owned property or formalized legal obligations (<i>see GSL Enters<\/i>. <i>v Lopez<\/i>, 239 AD2d 122 [1997]; <i>Seminole Realty Co<\/i>. <i>v Greenbaum<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/seminole-realty-co-v-greenbaum-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">209 AD2d 345<\/a> [1994]). To the contrary, the evidence showed and the court expressly found that respondent's relationship with the tenant during the relevant period was that of \"friends, roommates and business colleagues.\" <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\">In response to our dissenting colleague's pedantic opinion, suffice it to say that the Appellate Division, First Department, in a case cited by the dissent, has cautioned that \"factual findings of the trial court should not be disturbed upon appeal unless it is obvious that its conclusions could not be reached under any fair interpretation of the evidence\" (<i>WSC Riverside Dr<\/i>. <i>Owners LLC v Williams<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/wsc-riverside-drive-owners-llc-v-williams-4#p459\" class=\"raw-ref\">125 AD3d 458, 459<\/a> [2015], <i>lv dismissed<\/i> 25 NY3d 1221 [2015]). We also note that the dissenter's criticisms of the experienced trial judge are unwarranted and in no way justified by the record. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\">Respondent's present challenge to the parties' pretrial stipulation is both unpreserved and lacking in merit.

Doris Ling-Cohan <\/p> <h3>Dissenting Opinion<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\">I respectfully dissent with the determination that respondent, Lillian Zenker (Zenker), was a mere \"friend, roommate, or business colleague\" of the deceased tenant, Richard Montgomery (Montgomery) and would reverse the Civil Court's order now on appeal, thereby granting succession rights to respondent Zenker, as a nontraditional \"family member\" (<i>see<\/i> Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2523-notices-and-records\/section-25235-notice-for-renewal-of-lease-and-renewal-procedure\" class=\"raw-ref\">\u00a7 2523.5<\/a> [b] [1] [\"RSC\"]). By affirming the decision below, the majority has now authorized trial courts to consider a factor explicitly directed by the legislature not to be considered and has proclaimed that it is proper for a trial court to completely ignore the relevant statute (RSC \u00a7 2520.6 [o] [2]) and the eight (8) factors explicitly set forth for consideration by the legislature therein, in succession cases. As explained below, the trial judge erred in failing to cite to, or consider, any of the relevant factors listed in the Rent Stabilization Code, and instead relied on a factor explicitly barred from consideration by the RSC. Additionally, <i>pro se<\/i> respondent fully established at the trial that she met all of the eight (8) factors listed in the RSC and that her caring, long-term relationship with Montgomery, of over 30 years, was characterized with the requisite \"emotional and financial commitment, and interdependence\" (Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] \u00a7 2520.6 [o] [2]), entitling her to succession. <i> <b>The Applicable Law<\/b> <\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\">The Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) \u00a7 2520.6 (o) (2), not discussed or even mentioned by the trial judge, defines \"[f]amily member\" as including: \"[a]ny other person residing with the tenant...who can prove emotional and financial commitment, and interdependence between such person and the tenant...\". Although the Rent Stabilization Code makes explicit that \"no single factor shall be solely determinative, evidence which is to be considered in determining whether such emotional and financial commitment and interdependence existed, may include, without limitation, such factors as listed below...: (i) longevity of the relationship; (ii) sharing of or relying upon each other for payment of household or family expenses, and\/or other common necessities of life; (iii) intermingling of finances as evidenced by, among other things, joint ownership of bank accounts, personal and real property, credit cards, loan obligations, sharing household budget for purposes of receiving government benefits, etc.; (iv) engaging in family-type activities by jointly attending family functions, holidays and celebrations, social and recreational activities, etc.; (v) formalizing of legal obligations, intentions and responsibilities to each other by such means as executing wills naming each other as executor and\/or beneficiary, granting each other a power of attorney and\/or conferring upon each other authority to make health care decisions each for the other, entering into a personal relationship contract, making a domestic partnership declaration, or serving as a representative payee for purposes of public benefits, etc.; (vi) holding themselves out as family members to other family members, friends, members of the community or religious institutions, <span page-number=\"2\" pagination-id=\"570431\/14\" id=\"p2\"><\/span> or society in general, through their words or actions; (vii) regularly performing family functions, such as caring for each other or each other's extended family members, and\/or relying upon each other for daily family services; (viii) engaging in any other pattern of behavior, agreement, or other action which evidences the intention of creating a long-term, emotionally committed relationship\" (<i>id<\/i>.). Notwithstanding that the trial court failed to cite to or consider any of these factors, as detailed below, respondent satisfied all eight (8) of the listed factors in the RSC. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"15\" id=\"pa15\">Even under the standard articulated in <i>WSC Riverside Dr<\/i>. <i>Owners LLC v Wiliams<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/wsc-riverside-drive-owners-llc-v-williams-4#p459\" class=\"raw-ref\">125 AD3d 458, 459<\/a> [1st Dept 2015], <i>lv dismissed<\/i> 25 NY3d 1221 [2015], relied upon by the majority, reversal is appropriate as the only \"factual finding\" made by the trial judge below, and relied upon, was explicitly barred by the Rent Stabilization Code. Specifically, the lower court erred in making the factual finding that \"by her admission\" Zenker and the decedent \"were not romantically involved\" and relying solely on this factual finding in her one (1) page, double spaced, discussion<a note-disclosure=\"1\" href=\"#N3005D\"><\/a> n, thereby completely ignoring the applicable factors listed in the Rent Stabilization Code (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2]), without making any relevant factual findings, or, indeed even making a passing reference to any of the statutory factors, which are to be considered in deciding whether a respondent proved an emotional and financial commitment and interdependence, with the statutory tenant. The trial judge not only did not discuss any of the relevant factors, or make any factual findings as to any of the factors, but she also failed to cite to the relevant statute, or, any case law.  <\/p><div note-container=\"1\" id=\"N3005D\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"16\" id=\"pa16\"> In contrast, the procedural history of the case was longer than the discussion, in the three and a half (3 \u00bd) page decision. <br> <\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"17\" id=\"pa17\">While respondent's relationship with Montgomery, during the last eight (8) years of his life, was admittedly platonic (after the couple had a previous romantic relationship lasting for approximately nine [9] years), the lack of a sexual relationship is <i>not<\/i> a relevant factor that a court is permitted to consider (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2]). In fact, contrary to what the lower court did, the Rent Stabilization Code <i>explicitly states that<\/i>, \"[i]n no event would evidence of a sexual relationship between such persons be required or considered...\", in determining whether such \"emotional and financial commitment and interdependence\" existed (<a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2]). Thus, it was reversible error for the trial court to focus solely on the lack of a sexual relationship and not to consider the factors that the Rent Stabilization Code provides, in determining whether an emotional and financial commitment and interdependence existed. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"18\" id=\"pa18\">Instead of what the trial court did, the Court of Appeals has made clear that, in determining whether an individual is entitled to succession, a court is to look to the factors outlined in the Rent Stabilization Code, \"including the exclusivity and longevity of the relationship, the level of emotional and financial commitment, the manner in which the parties have conducted their everyday lives and held themselves out to society, and the reliance placed upon one another for daily family services\"(<i>Braschi v Stahl Assocs<\/i>. <i>Co<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/braschi-v-stahl-assocs-co-1#p212\" class=\"raw-ref\">74 NY2d 201, 212-213<\/a> [1989]; <i>see<\/i> Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">\u00a7 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2]). The presence or absence of one or more of such factors \"is not dispositive since it is the totality of the relationship as evidenced by the dedication, caring, and self-sacrifice of the parties which...control\" (<i>Braschi v Stahl Assocs<\/i>. <i>Co<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/braschi-v-stahl-assocs-co-1#p213\" class=\"raw-ref\">74 NY2d at 213<\/a>). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"19\" id=\"pa19\"> <i> <b>Satisfaction of All Eight RSC Factors<\/b> <\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"20\" id=\"pa20\">Here, all of the eight (8) factors in Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">\u00a7 2520.6 (o)(2)<\/a> were met by respondent Zenker. In reviewing the relevant factors as articulated by the Rent Stabilization Code and case law, which the lower court entirely failed to do, the evidence produced at trial reveals that respondent and decedent's over 30-year emotionally committed relationship was similar to that of a traditional family-type relationship, such that they relied on each other, with Montgomery willingly providing total financial support to respondent, and respondent performing the \"daily family services\" (<a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR \u00a7 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2] [vii]), including doing his laundry. It is undisputed that respondent lived with Montgomery in the <i>one<\/i> bedroom apartment during the eight (8) years immediately preceding his death, as well as for an additional nine (9) years, prior to such time. It is also undisputed that respondent was entirely financially dependent on Montgomery, from the time she moved back into the subject apartment in 2003, until the time of his death in 2011. During the last eight (8) years living together, Montgomery paid for all of the rent for the subject apartment, the utilities, and other household items, as well as for the couple's weekly restaurant meals. Respondent's sole means of income from 2003 until Montgomery's death, was her modest \"employment\" with Montgomery's home business and Montgomery also paid for an accountant to prepare respondent's tax returns. Respondent was, in essence, Montgomery's widow, having been totally supported by him financially, while respondent performed all the household domestic chores including cleaning, doing his laundry and cooking, from the food for which he paid (<i>see Arnie Realty Corp<\/i>. <i>v Torres<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/arnie-realty-corp-v-torres-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">294 AD2d 193<\/a> [1st Dept 2002][respondent who lived with deceased tenant for eight (8) years prior to tenant's death and was financially supported by tenant, while respondent provided domestic support, entitled to succession]; <i>St<\/i>. <i>Marks Assets<\/i>, <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Herzog<\/i>, 196 Misc 2d 112, 113 [App Term, 1st Dept 2003] [tenant entitled to succession as a nontraditional family member, where \"tenant financially supported the household while respondent, who was not employed, performed various home duties\"]). In fact, the funeral home worksheet prepared after Montgomery's death, which was admitted into evidence, lists Zenker as Montgomery's wife and demonstrates that the couple held themselves out as family members to society, a factor to be considered under the RSC (<a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR \u00a7 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2] [vi]). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"21\" id=\"pa21\">As further evidence of the couple's closeness and emotional commitment, respondent testified that when she moved back into the subject apartment, Montgomery welcomed her back - notwithstanding that the apartment only had one bedroom - which he sacrificed for respondent for the entire eight (8) years prior to his death, while he slept on the living room couch. Also, numerous cards and notes in which Montgomery expressed his deep love for respondent were admitted into evidence. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"22\" id=\"pa22\">After Montgomery's death, respondent had the responsibility of making the arrangements and paying for his funeral and burial. Also, respondent testified without objection that she was the sole beneficiary of Montgomery's 401K, and that the couple shared a joint bank account (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2] [v]; <i>Roberts Ave v Sullivan<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/roberts-avenue-associates-v-sullivan\" class=\"raw-ref\">2003 NY Slip Op 51091<\/a>[U][App Term, 1st Dept 2003][in reversing the trial court's determination that the relationship at issue was merely a \"friendship of roommates\", the Appellate Term considered respondent's arrangement for and payment of decedent's burial, as a factor, in determining that respondent was a non-traditional family member entitled to succession]).

While the majority points to that, at the trial, \"neither testimony from friends, neighbors, or family members corroborating a family-type relationship between the two, nor any documentary or other credible evidence that Zenker and Montgomery intermingled finances, jointly owned property or formalized legal obligations\", nevertheless, there was an abundance of <b>unrefuted<\/b> evidence that the relationship between Zenker and Montgomery was one of longevity of over 30 years and intense emotional and financial commitment, as evidenced by the way the couple conducted their daily lives, held themselves out to society, and relied upon each other for financial and daily family services (s<i>ee Braschi v Stahl Associates Co<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/braschi-v-stahl-assocs-co-1#p212\" class=\"raw-ref\">74 NY2d at 212-213<\/a>). Significantly, it is well settled that, \"[t]he absence of documentary evidence of financial interdependence does not undermine an otherwise valid succession claim where the totality of the circumstances evinces a long-term relationship [such as the one at issue herein] characterized by emotional and financial commitment\" (<i>St<\/i>. <i>Marks Assets<\/i>, <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Herzog<\/i>, 196 Misc 2d at 113 [citation omitted]; s<i>ee also RHM Estates v Hampshire<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/rhm-estates-v-hampshire-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">18 AD3d 326<\/a> [1st Dept 2005][\"[w]hile the statute considers intermingling of finances, the absence of this factor...does not negate the conclusion that [tenant] and respondent had [a] family-like relationship\"]; <i>WSC Riverside Drive Owners LLC v Williams<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/wsc-riverside-drive-owners-llc-v-williams-4#p459\" class=\"raw-ref\">125 AD3d 458, 459<\/a> [1st Dept 2015][the Appellate Division, in reversing the Appellate Term's reversal of the Civil Court's finding of succession, noted \"that in considering whether a person may be a considered a family member'..., no single factor shall be solely determinative...'\" and that a \"modest intermingling of finances does not [necessarily] negate the conclusion...[of] a family-like relationship\"]; <i>Arnie Realty Corp<\/i>. <i>v Torres<\/i>, 294 AD2d at 193 [even in the absence of documentary evidence of financial interdependence, respondent who lived with deceased tenant for eight (8) years prior to tenant's death and was financially supported by tenant, while respondent provided domestic support, entitled to succession]; <i>Roberts Ave v Sullivan<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/roberts-avenue-associates-v-sullivan\" class=\"raw-ref\">2003 NY Slip Op 51091<\/a>[U][App Term, 1st Dept 2003][despite a lack of documentary evidence of intermingling finances, the Appellate Term determined that respondent was a non-traditional family member entitled to succession]). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"24\" id=\"pa24\">This is particularly true here, where respondent appeared at the trial in this case, <i>pro se<\/i>, and, thus, handicapped by her lack of legal knowledge as to evidentiary rules, so that when she attempted to provide additional documentary evidence consisting of \"several hundred pages\", as quantified by the judge (Tr. at 129), much of it was not in a form acceptable to the court. Indeed, a large portion of the trial transcript is comprised of long discussions as to the admissibility of documents, rather than actual testimony. It is noted that, at no point during the trial, or in her <span page-number=\"4\" pagination-id=\"570431\/14\" id=\"p4\"><\/span> decision, did the trial judge discuss the relevant statutory factors which <i>pro se<\/i> respondent needed to fulfill, in her attempt to prove her claim of succession to the subject apartment. Nor was <i>pro se<\/i> respondent ever presented with the text of the Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">\u00a7 2520.6 (o)(2)<\/a> listing the factors to be considered, and simply asked how she satisfies the definition of a nontraditional family member, entitled to succession. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"25\" id=\"pa25\">As this was not a straightforward nonpayment proceeding and the statutory factors were never listed in the pleadings, an unrepresented litigant would have no basis to know what factors the court was obligated to consider. It is noted that the within proceeding was commenced as a nonpayment proceeding and converted to a holdover proceeding, by stipulation, and, thus, a self represented litigant would not even be aware of the applicable Rent Stabilization Code section, much less the relevant factors; nor was she ever apprised by the judge of the proceedings of the applicable RSC section, or of its factors to be considered, thereby depriving her of a full opportunity to be heard and defend herself. Nothing in the nonpayment pleadings gave Zenker notice of the specific grounds of the holdover. Nor did the bare-bones stipulation converting it into a holdover notify her of the grounds to evict. It appears that the first notice that the basis was \"succession\" is when the trial judge mentioned the word to her in the beginning of the trial, at which she appeared <i>pro se<\/i>. Nevertheless, respondent's testimony of an emotionally committed relationship, of a long duration, and her satisfaction of all of the eight (8) factors to be considered under Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">\u00a7 2520.6 (o)(2)<\/a>, was unrefuted. At the very minimum, this matter should be remanded to the trial court, to further establish the record and for a full examination of each factor under the Rent Stabilization Code. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"26\" id=\"pa26\">The two cases relied upon by the majority, <i>Seminole Realty Co<\/i>. <i>v Greenbaum<\/i> (<a href=\"\/case\/seminole-realty-co-v-greenbaum-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">209 AD2d 345<\/a> [1st Dept 1994]) and <i>GSL Enters<\/i>. <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Lopez<\/i> (239 AD2d 122 [1st Dept 1997]), are distinguishable. In <i>Seminole Realty Co<\/i>. <i>v Greenbaum<\/i>, the respondent never \"jointly celebrated most major holidays or attended important celebrations with each other's families\" (<i>Seminole Realty Co<\/i>. <i>v Greenbaum<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/seminole-realty-co-v-greenbaum-1#p346\" class=\"raw-ref\">209 AD2d 345, 346<\/a> [1st Dept, 1994]). Whereas, here, respondent supplied pictures, at trial, of the decedent and respondent celebrating numerous special occasions and holidays, with one another's families. Although the photos, provided at trial, were not during the relevant eight year period, there is no dispute, that, at the very least, respondent and decedent celebrated the holidays together. Nevertheless, as indicated, respondent Zenker satisfied all of the relevant factors listed in Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">\u00a7 2520.6 (o)(2)<\/a>. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"27\" id=\"pa27\">Additionally, the facts of <i>GSL Enters<\/i>. <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Lopez<\/i> (239 AD2d 122 [1st Dept 1997]) are remarkably different from the within case. Significantly, in <i>GSL Enters<\/i>. <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Lopez<\/i>, \"the tenant [actually] executed a power of attorney in favor of his sister, and amended his will to include his desire that his sister inherit' the apartment [rather than the respondent]\" (239 AD2d at 122). Here, there was no will evidencing Montogomery's desire that the subject apartment be bequeathed to any individual other than respondent Zenker. In fact, there was unrefuted evidence identifying his wish that respondent Zenker be taken care of after his passing, indicating a close caring family relationship. Respondent testified that Montgomery told her where all his valuables were located, that he wanted her to have everything, that Montgomery had a 401(k), of which she was a beneficiary, and, admitted into evidence was a letter from decedent to respondent, dated April 23, 1996, stating that Montgomery wanted \"to do right by\" respondent. Nor was there any evidence that there were any other beneficiaries other than her. While the <span page-number=\"5\" pagination-id=\"570431\/14\" id=\"p5\"><\/span> majority relies on <i>GSL Enters Inc v Lopez<\/i> because similarly there was, \"no testimony from friends, neighbors, or family members corroborating a family-type, as opposed to close-friend-and-roommate relationship\", such lack of testimony of a family-type relationship from others does not negate the totality of the <b>unrefuted<\/b> evidence of the quasi-familial relationship she had with Montgomery. Further, perhaps, if <i>pro se<\/i> litigant had the benefit of counsel at trial, she might have been able to meet this unarticulated standard of the need for corroborative testimony (even when her testimony was unrefuted), which is not listed in the Rent Stabilization Code. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"28\" id=\"pa28\">While due deference is usually given to the trial court's determination with respect to issues of credibility, and, notwithstanding that an intermediate appellate court must \"take into account that in a close case the trial judge has the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses\" (<i>Marinoff v Natty Realty Corp<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/marinoff-v-natty-realty-corp-1#p767\" class=\"raw-ref\">34 AD3d 765, 767<\/a>; <i>Zere Real Estate Servs<\/i>., <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Parr Gen<\/i>. <i>Contr<\/i>. <i>Co<\/i>., <i>Inc<\/i>., 102 AD3d at 772), nevertheless, where a matter is tried without a jury, the authority of this court on appeal is as broad as that of the trial court and we may render a judgment warranted by the facts (<i>Northern Westchester Professional Park Assoc<\/i>. <i>v Town of Bedford<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/professional-park-v-bedford#p499\" class=\"raw-ref\">60 NY2d 492, 499<\/a> [1983]). Here, notably, the lower court, in its decision now on appeal, erred in failing to even reference the statute (or any case law), or evaluate any of the relevant statutory factors, in its determination as to whether respondent proved entitlement to succession as a nontraditional family member and did not make any express findings as to credibility. While the majority unfortunately characterizes this failure to cite to or consider the statute as \"unwarranted\" \"criticisms of an experienced judge\", nonetheless, even \"experienced judges\" are obligated to consider and cite to the relevant law, and provide an unrepresented litigant with due process by indicating the relevant RSC section, to which the litigant's case is to be determined, given that the pleadings failed to so advise her.<a note-disclosure=\"2\" href=\"#N3014F\"><\/a> Clearly, the role of an appellate judge is to review cases, rather than give a free pass to judges merely because they are \"experienced judges\", which is a grave disservice to litigants.  <\/p><div note-container=\"2\" id=\"N3014F\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"29\" id=\"pa29\"> In fact, even extremely experienced judges of this country's highest court are not above making mistakes and have admitted errors about the law (Marcia Coyle, <i>When Justices Offer Their Regrets<\/i>, <i>It's Usually About the Law<\/i>, NYLJ, July 18, 2016 at 2, col 1).<\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"30\" id=\"pa30\"> <i> <b>Conclusion<\/b> <\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"31\" id=\"pa31\">As stated by the Court of Appeals, \"the term family [member], as used in [the Rent Stabilization Code], should not be rigidly restricted to those people who have formalized their relationship...[t]he intended protection against sudden eviction should not rest on fictitious legal distinctions or genetic history, but instead should find its foundation in the reality of family life\" (<i>Braschi v<\/i>. <i>Stahl Assoc<\/i>. <i>Co<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/braschi-v-stahl-assocs-co-1#p211\" class=\"raw-ref\">74 NY2d at 211<\/a>). Here, in view of the totality of the relationship, the sufficient factors under the RSC (which it is undisputed that the relevant statute was not reviewed or cited to by the trial judge), exist to warrant a finding that respondent Zenker and Montgomery exhibited the dedication, caring, and self-sacrifice, seen in familial relationships, for respondent to be entitled to succession rights, as a non-traditional family member (<i>see id<\/i>. at 213). The lower court and the majority's description of respondent's relationship with Montgomery, as that of mere \"friends, roommates and business colleagues\" is contrary to the undisputed evidence which, instead, established a long-term committed and emotional family-type relationship, of a kind entitled to succession, under the RSC. Their relationship, of over 30 years, involved typical day-to-day family-type chores and responsibilities entirely <span page-number=\"6\" pagination-id=\"570431\/14\" id=\"p6\"><\/span> uncharacteristic of a mere \"friend, roommate or business\" relationship, including, <i>inter alia<\/i>, Zenker doing Montgomery's laundry, preparing their meals daily, dining together in their home and in restaurants, Montgomery supporting and paying for all of Zenker's needs, accompanying each other to medical appointments and making and financing funeral and burial arrangements. Simply put, ordinarily, mere \"friends, roommates and business colleagues\" do not cook meals for each other on a daily basis, nor do they do each other's dirty laundry and other domestic chores - as Zenker undisputably did for Montgomery, during the last eight (8) years of his life. Nor do mere \"friends, roommates and business colleagues\" provide total financial support to one another, as indisputably Montgomery did for Zenker. Family members, however, do perform these acts, particularly those in a long-term committed, caring and self-sacrificing relationship, such as Zenker and Montgomery. Accordingly, I would reverse or, at a minimum, remand for consideration of the eight (8) statutory factors, under the Rent Stabilization Code (<a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2]), which the trial judge failed to even consider, cite to, or discuss in its decision. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"32\" id=\"pa32\">THIS CONSTITUTES THE DECISION AND ORDER OF THE COURT. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"33\" id=\"pa33\">Decision Date: February 22, 2017 <\/p> <\/section><hr> <\/section>","title":"<p><span class=\"font-weight-bold mr-1\">Full title:<\/span>530 Second Ave. Co., LLC Petitioner-Landlord-Respondent, v.

While respondent and tenant may have lived together in a close relationship at one time, it is not disputed that the parties separated in 1988 and respondent then lived elsewhere for some 15 years. Although respondent moved back into the apartment in 2003 - because she was facing eviction from her basement apartment in Queens - there was no evidence that she thereafter resided with tenant in a relationship characterized by \"emotional and financial commitment and interdependence\" (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2523-notices-and-records\/section-25235-notice-for-renewal-of-lease-and-renewal-procedure\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR \u00a7 2523.5<\/a> [b][1]). There was neither testimony from friends, neighbors, or family members corroborating a family-type relationship between the two, nor any documentary or other credible evidence that respondent and tenant intermingled finances, jointly owned property or formalized legal obligations (<i>see GSL Enters<\/i>. <i>v Lopez<\/i>, 239 AD2d 122 [1997]; <i>Seminole Realty Co<\/i>. <i>v Greenbaum<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/seminole-realty-co-v-greenbaum-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">209 AD2d 345<\/a> [1994]). To the contrary, the evidence showed and the court expressly found that respondent's relationship with the tenant during the relevant period was that of \"friends, roommates and business colleagues.\" <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\">In response to our dissenting colleague's pedantic opinion, suffice it to say that the Appellate Division, First Department, in a case cited by the dissent, has cautioned that \"factual findings of the trial court should not be disturbed upon appeal unless it is obvious that its conclusions could not be reached under any fair interpretation of the evidence\" (<i>WSC Riverside Dr<\/i>. <i>Owners LLC v Williams<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/wsc-riverside-drive-owners-llc-v-williams-4#p459\" class=\"raw-ref\">125 AD3d 458, 459<\/a> [2015], <i>lv dismissed<\/i> 25 NY3d 1221 [2015]).

By affirming the decision below, the majority has now authorized trial courts to consider a factor explicitly directed by the legislature not to be considered and has proclaimed that it is proper for a trial court to completely ignore the relevant statute (RSC \u00a7 2520.6 [o] [2]) and the eight (8) factors explicitly set forth for consideration by the legislature therein, in succession cases. As explained below, the trial judge erred in failing to cite to, or consider, any of the relevant factors listed in the Rent Stabilization Code, and instead relied on a factor explicitly barred from consideration by the RSC. Additionally, <i>pro se<\/i> respondent fully established at the trial that she met all of the eight (8) factors listed in the RSC and that her caring, long-term relationship with Montgomery, of over 30 years, was characterized with the requisite \"emotional and financial commitment, and interdependence\" (Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] \u00a7 2520.6 [o] [2]), entitling her to succession. <i> <b>The Applicable Law<\/b> <\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\">The Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) \u00a7 2520.6 (o) (2), not discussed or even mentioned by the trial judge, defines \"[f]amily member\" as including: \"[a]ny other person residing with the tenant...who can prove emotional and financial commitment, and interdependence between such person and the tenant...\". Although the Rent Stabilization Code makes explicit that \"no single factor shall be solely determinative, evidence which is to be considered in determining whether such emotional and financial commitment and interdependence existed, may include, without limitation, such factors as listed below...: (i) longevity of the relationship; (ii) sharing of or relying upon each other for payment of household or family expenses, and\/or other common necessities of life; (iii) intermingling of finances as evidenced by, among other things, joint ownership of bank accounts, personal and real property, credit cards, loan obligations, sharing household budget for purposes of receiving government benefits, etc.; (iv) engaging in family-type activities by jointly attending family functions, holidays and celebrations, social and recreational activities, etc.; (v) formalizing of legal obligations, intentions and responsibilities to each other by such means as executing wills naming each other as executor and\/or beneficiary, granting each other a power of attorney and\/or conferring upon each other authority to make health care decisions each for the other, entering into a personal relationship contract, making a domestic partnership declaration, or serving as a representative payee for purposes of public benefits, etc.; (vi) holding themselves out as family members to other family members, friends, members of the community or religious institutions, <span page-number=\"2\" pagination-id=\"570431\/14\" id=\"p2\"><\/span> or society in general, through their words or actions; (vii) regularly performing family functions, such as caring for each other or each other's extended family members, and\/or relying upon each other for daily family services; (viii) engaging in any other pattern of behavior, agreement, or other action which evidences the intention of creating a long-term, emotionally committed relationship\" (<i>id<\/i>.).

In reviewing the relevant factors as articulated by the Rent Stabilization Code and case law, which the lower court entirely failed to do, the evidence produced at trial reveals that respondent and decedent's over 30-year emotionally committed relationship was similar to that of a traditional family-type relationship, such that they relied on each other, with Montgomery willingly providing total financial support to respondent, and respondent performing the \"daily family services\" (<a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR \u00a7 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2] [vii]), including doing his laundry. It is undisputed that respondent lived with Montgomery in the <i>one<\/i> bedroom apartment during the eight (8) years immediately preceding his death, as well as for an additional nine (9) years, prior to such time. It is also undisputed that respondent was entirely financially dependent on Montgomery, from the time she moved back into the subject apartment in 2003, until the time of his death in 2011. During the last eight (8) years living together, Montgomery paid for all of the rent for the subject apartment, the utilities, and other household items, as well as for the couple's weekly restaurant meals. Respondent's sole means of income from 2003 until Montgomery's death, was her modest \"employment\" with Montgomery's home business and Montgomery also paid for an accountant to prepare respondent's tax returns. Respondent was, in essence, Montgomery's widow, having been totally supported by him financially, while respondent performed all the household domestic chores including cleaning, doing his laundry and cooking, from the food for which he paid (<i>see Arnie Realty Corp<\/i>. <i>v Torres<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/arnie-realty-corp-v-torres-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">294 AD2d 193<\/a> [1st Dept 2002][respondent who lived with deceased tenant for eight (8) years prior to tenant's death and was financially supported by tenant, while respondent provided domestic support, entitled to succession]; <i>St<\/i>. <i>Marks Assets<\/i>, <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Herzog<\/i>, 196 Misc 2d 112, 113 [App Term, 1st Dept 2003] [tenant entitled to succession as a nontraditional family member, where \"tenant financially supported the household while respondent, who was not employed, performed various home duties\"]). In fact, the funeral home worksheet prepared after Montgomery's death, which was admitted into evidence, lists Zenker as Montgomery's wife and demonstrates that the couple held themselves out as family members to society, a factor to be considered under the RSC (<a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR \u00a7 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2] [vi]). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"21\" id=\"pa21\">As further evidence of the couple's closeness and emotional commitment, respondent testified that when she moved back into the subject apartment, Montgomery welcomed her back - notwithstanding that the apartment only had one bedroom - which he sacrificed for respondent for the entire eight (8) years prior to his death, while he slept on the living room couch. Also, numerous cards and notes in which Montgomery expressed his deep love for respondent were admitted into evidence. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"22\" id=\"pa22\">After Montgomery's death, respondent had the responsibility of making the arrangements and paying for his funeral and burial. Also, respondent testified without objection that she was the sole beneficiary of Montgomery's 401K, and that the couple shared a joint bank account (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2] [v]; <i>Roberts Ave v Sullivan<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/roberts-avenue-associates-v-sullivan\" class=\"raw-ref\">2003 NY Slip Op 51091<\/a>[U][App Term, 1st Dept 2003][in reversing the trial court's determination that the relationship at issue was merely a \"friendship of roommates\", the Appellate Term considered respondent's arrangement for and payment of decedent's burial, as a factor, in determining that respondent was a non-traditional family member entitled to succession]).

It is undisputed that the record reflects that respondent and Montgomery ate meals together at home and in restaurants, and accompanied one another to medical appointments, as well as to the hospital (<i>see id<\/i>.). While the majority points to that, at the trial, \"neither testimony from friends, neighbors, or family members corroborating a family-type relationship between the two, nor any documentary or other credible evidence that Zenker and Montgomery intermingled finances, jointly owned property or formalized legal obligations\", nevertheless, there was an abundance of <b>unrefuted<\/b> evidence that the relationship between Zenker and Montgomery was one of longevity of over 30 years and intense emotional and financial commitment, as evidenced by the way the couple conducted their daily lives, held themselves out to society, and relied upon each other for financial and daily family services (s<i>ee Braschi v Stahl Associates Co<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/braschi-v-stahl-assocs-co-1#p212\" class=\"raw-ref\">74 NY2d at 212-213<\/a>). Significantly, it is well settled that, \"[t]he absence of documentary evidence of financial interdependence does not undermine an otherwise valid succession claim where the totality of the circumstances evinces a long-term relationship [such as the one at issue herein] characterized by emotional and financial commitment\" (<i>St<\/i>. <i>Marks Assets<\/i>, <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Herzog<\/i>, 196 Misc 2d at 113 [citation omitted]; s<i>ee also RHM Estates v Hampshire<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/rhm-estates-v-hampshire-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">18 AD3d 326<\/a> [1st Dept 2005][\"[w]hile the statute considers intermingling of finances, the absence of this factor...does not negate the conclusion that [tenant] and respondent had [a] family-like relationship\"]; <i>WSC Riverside Drive Owners LLC v Williams<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/wsc-riverside-drive-owners-llc-v-williams-4#p459\" class=\"raw-ref\">125 AD3d 458, 459<\/a> [1st Dept 2015][the Appellate Division, in reversing the Appellate Term's reversal of the Civil Court's finding of succession, noted \"that in considering whether a person may be a considered a family member'..., no single factor shall be solely determinative...'\" and that a \"modest intermingling of finances does not [necessarily] negate the conclusion...[of] a family-like relationship\"]; <i>Arnie Realty Corp<\/i>. <i>v Torres<\/i>, 294 AD2d at 193 [even in the absence of documentary evidence of financial interdependence, respondent who lived with deceased tenant for eight (8) years prior to tenant's death and was financially supported by tenant, while respondent provided domestic support, entitled to succession]; <i>Roberts Ave v Sullivan<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/roberts-avenue-associates-v-sullivan\" class=\"raw-ref\">2003 NY Slip Op 51091<\/a>[U][App Term, 1st Dept 2003][despite a lack of documentary evidence of intermingling finances, the Appellate Term determined that respondent was a non-traditional family member entitled to succession]). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"24\" id=\"pa24\">This is particularly true here, where respondent appeared at the trial in this case, <i>pro se<\/i>, and, thus, handicapped by her lack of legal knowledge as to evidentiary rules, so that when she attempted to provide additional documentary evidence consisting of \"several hundred pages\", as quantified by the judge (Tr. at 129), much of it was not in a form acceptable to the court. Indeed, a large portion of the trial transcript is comprised of long discussions as to the admissibility of documents, rather than actual testimony. It is noted that, at no point during the trial, or in her <span page-number=\"4\" pagination-id=\"570431\/14\" id=\"p4\"><\/span> decision, did the trial judge discuss the relevant statutory factors which <i>pro se<\/i> respondent needed to fulfill, in her attempt to prove her claim of succession to the subject apartment. Nor was <i>pro se<\/i> respondent ever presented with the text of the Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">\u00a7 2520.6 (o)(2)<\/a> listing the factors to be considered, and simply asked how she satisfies the definition of a nontraditional family member, entitled to succession. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"25\" id=\"pa25\">As this was not a straightforward nonpayment proceeding and the statutory factors were never listed in the pleadings, an unrepresented litigant would have no basis to know what factors the court was obligated to consider. It is noted that the within proceeding was commenced as a nonpayment proceeding and converted to a holdover proceeding, by stipulation, and, thus, a self represented litigant would not even be aware of the applicable Rent Stabilization Code section, much less the relevant factors; nor was she ever apprised by the judge of the proceedings of the applicable RSC section, or of its factors to be considered, thereby depriving her of a full opportunity to be heard and defend herself. Nothing in the nonpayment pleadings gave Zenker notice of the specific grounds of the holdover. Nor did the bare-bones stipulation converting it into a holdover notify her of the grounds to evict. It appears that the first notice that the basis was \"succession\" is when the trial judge mentioned the word to her in the beginning of the trial, at which she appeared <i>pro se<\/i>. Nevertheless, respondent's testimony of an emotionally committed relationship, of a long duration, and her satisfaction of all of the eight (8) factors to be considered under Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">\u00a7 2520.6 (o)(2)<\/a>, was unrefuted. At the very minimum, this matter should be remanded to the trial court, to further establish the record and for a full examination of each factor under the Rent Stabilization Code. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"26\" id=\"pa26\">The two cases relied upon by the majority, <i>Seminole Realty Co<\/i>. <i>v Greenbaum<\/i> (<a href=\"\/case\/seminole-realty-co-v-greenbaum-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">209 AD2d 345<\/a> [1st Dept 1994]) and <i>GSL Enters<\/i>. <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Lopez<\/i> (239 AD2d 122 [1st Dept 1997]), are distinguishable. In <i>Seminole Realty Co<\/i>. <i>v Greenbaum<\/i>, the respondent never \"jointly celebrated most major holidays or attended important celebrations with each other's families\" (<i>Seminole Realty Co<\/i>. <i>v Greenbaum<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/seminole-realty-co-v-greenbaum-1#p346\" class=\"raw-ref\">209 AD2d 345, 346<\/a> [1st Dept, 1994]). Whereas, here, respondent supplied pictures, at trial, of the decedent and respondent celebrating numerous special occasions and holidays, with one another's families. Although the photos, provided at trial, were not during the relevant eight year period, there is no dispute, that, at the very least, respondent and decedent celebrated the holidays together. Nevertheless, as indicated, respondent Zenker satisfied all of the relevant factors listed in Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) <a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">\u00a7 2520.6 (o)(2)<\/a>. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"27\" id=\"pa27\">Additionally, the facts of <i>GSL Enters<\/i>. <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Lopez<\/i> (239 AD2d 122 [1st Dept 1997]) are remarkably different from the within case. Significantly, in <i>GSL Enters<\/i>. <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Lopez<\/i>, \"the tenant [actually] executed a power of attorney in favor of his sister, and amended his will to include his desire that his sister inherit' the apartment [rather than the respondent]\" (239 AD2d at 122). Here, there was no will evidencing Montogomery's desire that the subject apartment be bequeathed to any individual other than respondent Zenker. In fact, there was unrefuted evidence identifying his wish that respondent Zenker be taken care of after his passing, indicating a close caring family relationship. Respondent testified that Montgomery told her where all his valuables were located, that he wanted her to have everything, that Montgomery had a 401(k), of which she was a beneficiary, and, admitted into evidence was a letter from decedent to respondent, dated April 23, 1996, stating that Montgomery wanted \"to do right by\" respondent. Nor was there any evidence that there were any other beneficiaries other than her. While the <span page-number=\"5\" pagination-id=\"570431\/14\" id=\"p5\"><\/span> majority relies on <i>GSL Enters Inc v Lopez<\/i> because similarly there was, \"no testimony from friends, neighbors, or family members corroborating a family-type, as opposed to close-friend-and-roommate relationship\", such lack of testimony of a family-type relationship from others does not negate the totality of the <b>unrefuted<\/b> evidence of the quasi-familial relationship she had with Montgomery. Further, perhaps, if <i>pro se<\/i> litigant had the benefit of counsel at trial, she might have been able to meet this unarticulated standard of the need for corroborative testimony (even when her testimony was unrefuted), which is not listed in the Rent Stabilization Code. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"28\" id=\"pa28\">While due deference is usually given to the trial court's determination with respect to issues of credibility, and, notwithstanding that an intermediate appellate court must \"take into account that in a close case the trial judge has the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses\" (<i>Marinoff v Natty Realty Corp<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/marinoff-v-natty-realty-corp-1#p767\" class=\"raw-ref\">34 AD3d 765, 767<\/a>; <i>Zere Real Estate Servs<\/i>., <i>Inc<\/i>. <i>v Parr Gen<\/i>. <i>Contr<\/i>. <i>Co<\/i>., <i>Inc<\/i>., 102 AD3d at 772), nevertheless, where a matter is tried without a jury, the authority of this court on appeal is as broad as that of the trial court and we may render a judgment warranted by the facts (<i>Northern Westchester Professional Park Assoc<\/i>. <i>v Town of Bedford<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/professional-park-v-bedford#p499\" class=\"raw-ref\">60 NY2d 492, 499<\/a> [1983]). Here, notably, the lower court, in its decision now on appeal, erred in failing to even reference the statute (or any case law), or evaluate any of the relevant statutory factors, in its determination as to whether respondent proved entitlement to succession as a nontraditional family member and did not make any express findings as to credibility. While the majority unfortunately characterizes this failure to cite to or consider the statute as \"unwarranted\" \"criticisms of an experienced judge\", nonetheless, even \"experienced judges\" are obligated to consider and cite to the relevant law, and provide an unrepresented litigant with due process by indicating the relevant RSC section, to which the litigant's case is to be determined, given that the pleadings failed to so advise her.<a note-disclosure=\"2\" href=\"#N3014F\"><\/a> Clearly, the role of an appellate judge is to review cases, rather than give a free pass to judges merely because they are \"experienced judges\", which is a grave disservice to litigants.  <\/p><div note-container=\"2\" id=\"N3014F\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"29\" id=\"pa29\"> In fact, even extremely experienced judges of this country's highest court are not above making mistakes and have admitted errors about the law (Marcia Coyle, <i>When Justices Offer Their Regrets<\/i>, <i>It's Usually About the Law<\/i>, NYLJ, July 18, 2016 at 2, col 1).<\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"30\" id=\"pa30\"> <i> <b>Conclusion<\/b> <\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"31\" id=\"pa31\">As stated by the Court of Appeals, \"the term family [member], as used in [the Rent Stabilization Code], should not be rigidly restricted to those people who have formalized their relationship...[t]he intended protection against sudden eviction should not rest on fictitious legal distinctions or genetic history, but instead should find its foundation in the reality of family life\" (<i>Braschi v<\/i>. <i>Stahl Assoc<\/i>. <i>Co<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/braschi-v-stahl-assocs-co-1#p211\" class=\"raw-ref\">74 NY2d at 211<\/a>). Here, in view of the totality of the relationship, the sufficient factors under the RSC (which it is undisputed that the relevant statute was not reviewed or cited to by the trial judge), exist to warrant a finding that respondent Zenker and Montgomery exhibited the dedication, caring, and self-sacrifice, seen in familial relationships, for respondent to be entitled to succession rights, as a non-traditional family member (<i>see id<\/i>. at 213). The lower court and the majority's description of respondent's relationship with Montgomery, as that of mere \"friends, roommates and business colleagues\" is contrary to the undisputed evidence which, instead, established a long-term committed and emotional family-type relationship, of a kind entitled to succession, under the RSC. Their relationship, of over 30 years, involved typical day-to-day family-type chores and responsibilities entirely <span page-number=\"6\" pagination-id=\"570431\/14\" id=\"p6\"><\/span> uncharacteristic of a mere \"friend, roommate or business\" relationship, including, <i>inter alia<\/i>, Zenker doing Montgomery's laundry, preparing their meals daily, dining together in their home and in restaurants, Montgomery supporting and paying for all of Zenker's needs, accompanying each other to medical appointments and making and financing funeral and burial arrangements. Simply put, ordinarily, mere \"friends, roommates and business colleagues\" do not cook meals for each other on a daily basis, nor do they do each other's dirty laundry and other domestic chores - as Zenker undisputably did for Montgomery, during the last eight (8) years of his life. Nor do mere \"friends, roommates and business colleagues\" provide total financial support to one another, as indisputably Montgomery did for Zenker. Family members, however, do perform these acts, particularly those in a long-term committed, caring and self-sacrificing relationship, such as Zenker and Montgomery. Accordingly, I would reverse or, at a minimum, remand for consideration of the eight (8) statutory factors, under the Rent Stabilization Code (<a href=\"\/regulation\/new-york-codes-rules-and-regulations\/title-9-executive-department\/subtitle-s-division-of-housing-and-community-renewal\/chapter-viii-rent-stabilization-regulations\/subchapter-b-rent-stabilization-code\/part-2520-scope\/section-25206-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 NYCRR 2520.6<\/a> [o] [2]), which the trial judge failed to even consider, cite to, or discuss in its decision. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"32\" id=\"pa32\">THIS CONSTITUTES THE DECISION AND ORDER OF THE COURT. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"33\" id=\"pa33\">Decision Date: February 22, 2017 <\/p> <\/section><hr> <\/section>","title":"<p><span class=\"font-weight-bold mr-1\">Full title:<\/span>530 Second Ave. Co., LLC Petitioner-Landlord-Respondent, v.

While no individual contributor's profile could be developed from the DNA mixtures on the other two swabs, OCME reports that the results of those swabs are nonetheless \"suitable for comparison,\" meaning that upon submission of a DNA sample from a known person, it might possibly be determined whether that person can be excluded or included as one of the three contributors to the mixture (People's Exh. 1).<a note-disclosure=\"2\" href=\"#N196648\"><\/a>   <\/p><div note-container=\"1\" id=\"N196637\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\"> Berroa was also charged under Docket No. 2017KN001063, but the People have withdrawn their motion as to him.

Haile,<\/i> Kings County Indictment 2682\u20132017 (Halle Opp. \u00b6 8; Halle Applic. for Subpoena Duces Tecum [\"Subpoena Applic.\"] \u00b6 9; P's Reply Mem. \u00b6 2). There are no particulars before the Court as to the circumstances under which that cigarette butt was recovered. The admissibility of the profile developed from it may be subject to challenge in either the indicted case or this one. Furthermore, the People explain in response to this Court's direct questions on the subject that although the DNA profile obtained from that pseudo-exemplar (number FBS16\u201303881) is governed by no protective order, it \"was not flagged for comparison <span page-number=\"641\" pagination-id=\"55 N.Y.S.3d 634\" id=\"p641\"><\/span>by the OCME\" because defendant gave a different name\u2014\"Haile\"\u2014in that case (P's Reply Aff. \u00b6 9).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"37\" id=\"pa37\">Defendant Halle takes the position that comparison of that pseudo-exemplar with the swabs of the gun\u2014no matter the result\u2014would obviate the need for a DNA order in this case. If the comparison were to show no match to any of the donors detected in the swab of the gun, Halle argues, that information would rule him out as a contributor to that DNA mixture, and would defeat the second requirement of <i>Abe A.<\/i> , that there be \"a clear indication that relevant material evidence will be found.\" On the other hand, if the pseudo-exemplar were to match one of the contributors to the DNA mixture on the gun, then using the profile from the pseudo-exemplar would be \"less intrusive\" than requiring a true exemplar that would merely \"duplicate\" evidence that the People already have (Halle Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"38\" id=\"pa38\">In support of his argument that the People must be content with the pseudo-exemplar they have, defendant Halle cites <i>People v. Golson,<\/i> Indict. No. 2591\u20132016 (Queens County April 3, 2017) (DiBiase, J.). In that case, however, an evidentiary sample in a burglary case was \"uploaded\"\u2014presumably to the State or National DNA Identification Index\u2014where it was matched to the defendant's DNA profile in that data bank. Such a databank profile would have been there only based on a true exemplar provided after a prior conviction.<a note-disclosure=\"9\" href=\"#N196819\"><\/a> In this case, by contrast, defendant has not conceded the authenticity of the profile developed in the indicted case against \"Haile\" and there is no support for defendant's assertion that his \"profile is in the New York State DNA databank\" (Halle Mem. at 10). Defendant has not stipulated that he and \"Haile\" are one and the same; nor has he stipulated that the pseudo-exemplar was obtained in a manner that did not violate defendant's (or \"Haile's\") Fourth Amendment rights and protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. <\/p><div note-container=\"9\" id=\"N196819\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"39\" id=\"pa39\"> Defendant has not provided a copy of this unpublished decision, leaving this Court to rely on the defendant's description of the case and descriptions it has read in similar submissions in other cases. This decision would not be binding authority on this Court in any event.<\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"40\" id=\"pa40\">The People are not required to make do with \"an abandonment sample purported to be taken from the defendant[ ]\" (P's Reply Aff. \u00b6 10 [emphasis in original] ), but are entitled to develop evidence as they see fit to meet their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (<i>Matter of <\/i> <i>Johnson v. Shillingford,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/johnson-v-shillingford\" class=\"raw-ref\">108 A.D.3d 630<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/johnson-v-shillingford\" class=\"raw-ref\">969 N.Y.S.2d 495<\/a> [2d Dept.2013] [order to compel granted even where defendant had offered to stipulate to DNA match] ). Nevertheless, the People have indicated that they would be willing to make use of the pseudo-exemplar from the other case if defendant Halle is willing to stipulate that it is his DNA (P's Reply Aff. \u00b6 11). Feggins, of course, is not in a position to make such a stipulation, and there is no alternative means to obtain his DNA profile.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"41\" id=\"pa41\">In all, this Court finds that the three-prong test in <i>Abe A.<\/i> is satisfied as to each defendant. There is probable cause to believe that at least one of the suspects possessed the gun; there is clear indication that a true exemplar would yield relevant material evidence; and the buccal swab method of rubbing a textured stick against the inside of the cheek is safe and reliable. Furthermore, the charge here is serious; evidence of possession of the gun is important to the investigation; and a buccal swab is a much less invasive procedure than the blood test ordered in <i>Abe A.<\/i> \u2014requiring barely more bodily intrusion <span page-number=\"642\" pagination-id=\"55 N.Y.S.3d 634\" id=\"p642\"><\/span>than use of a pseudo-exemplar. In all, the balancing test is also satisfied.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"42\" id=\"pa42\">The request for an order to compel a DNA sample from each of the defendants is therefore GRANTED.<a note-disclosure=\"10\" href=\"#N196848\"><\/a>  <\/p><div note-container=\"10\" id=\"N196848\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"43\" id=\"pa43\"> As the People note in their Reply, defendant Feggins's opposition to an order allowing the use of force is premature, as the People have not requested such a provision. The People will be free to request such an order should either defendant fail to cooperate with the collection of the oral DNA sample.<\/p> <\/div> <h3>Defendant's Request for a Protective Order<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"45\" id=\"pa45\"> Defendants have made cross-motions requesting that this Court include in any Orders a protective provision preventing OCME from maintaining their DNA profiles for any purpose other than comparison with the specific evidence in this case. The People oppose.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"46\" id=\"pa46\">The People describe that the OCME Forensic Biology laboratory has maintained a databank of DNA profiles generated during its analysis of cases since 1997, before New York City joined the national Combined DNA Index (CODIS) system. OCME's internal database was until recently called the \"Linkage\" database, but is now referred to as a Local DNA Index System (LDIS). OCME may upload DNA profiles from crime scene evidence to the State DNA Index System (SDIS); evidence in SDIS may in turn be uploaded to CODIS (P's Mtn Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 14\u201318).<a note-disclosure=\"11\" href=\"#N196859\"><\/a> However, as is illustrated in the flow chart provided by one of the defendants (Feggins Opp. at 7), and as the People acknowledge (P's Mtn Aff. \u00b6 16), only \"forensic\" profiles\u2014those developed from crime scene evidence\u2014may be uploaded for comparison to \"convicted offender\" profiles in the state and national databases. Putative profiles of suspects developed from pseudo-exemplars are in the LDIS along with other evidence recovered from whatever may be considered a \"crime scene.\" Like any evidence, however, their admissibility in any given case may be subject to challenge, and their relevance must be demonstrated. <\/p><div note-container=\"11\" id=\"N196859\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"47\" id=\"pa47\"> For purposes of this decision, it is not necessary to discuss the other types of evidence maintained in the LDIS related to missing persons and unidentified human remains.<\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"48\" id=\"pa48\">People argue that uploading the profile developed from a suspect's court-ordered DNA exemplar to the \"internal OCME databank\"\u2014whether that databank is referred to as Linkage or LDIS\u2014is \"an invaluable investigative tool\" enabling the establishment of \"links between seemingly unrelated crime scenes\" (P's Mtn. Aff. \u00b6 18). Without a protective order, however, a court-ordered DNA exemplar will be added to the LDIS, allowing OCME to draw connections \"between <i>suspects<\/i> and crimes\" (P's Mtn Aff. \u00b6 18, emphasis added) by comparing the known profile of a person who has not been convicted of any crime with unknown crime scene profiles from all over the five boroughs of New York City. Certainly, this ability is desirable to law enforcement seeking to identify patterns and close unsolved cases. In this Court's view, however, it is not consistent with the provisions of Executive Law Article 49\u2013B, which govern the use and dissemination of DNA profiles.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"49\" id=\"pa49\">The Forensic Biology lab of OCME is a \"Forensic DNA Laboratory,\" as that term is defined in Executive Law Article 49\u2013B, \u00a7 995(2). Its function is to \"perform[ ] forensic DNA testing on crime scenes or materials derived from the human body for use as evidence in a criminal proceeding or for purposes of identification\" (<i>id.<\/i> ). Only a \"designated offender subsequent to conviction and sentencing\" is required to \"provide a sample appropriate for DNA testing <span page-number=\"643\" pagination-id=\"55 N.Y.S.3d 634\" id=\"p643\"><\/span>to determine identification characteristics specific to such person and to be included in a state DNA identification index\" <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-executive\/article-49-b-commission-on-forensic-science-and-establishment-of-dna-identification-index\/section-995-c-state-dna-identification-index\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Exec. Law \u00a7 995\u2013c<\/a>[3] [a] ).<a note-disclosure=\"12\" href=\"#N196880\"><\/a> When such a convicted person provides a DNA exemplar, it is OCME's responsibility to \"forward the resulting DNA record only to the state DNA identification index in accordance with the regulations of the division of criminal justice services\" <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-executive\/article-49-b-commission-on-forensic-science-and-establishment-of-dna-identification-index\/section-995-c-state-dna-identification-index\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Exec. Law \u00a7 995\u2013c<\/a>[5] [emphasis added] ). In other words, and as the People acknowledge, OCME does not have unfettered access through its LDIS even to the profiles of convicted offenders maintained in SDIS, NDIS, or CODIS (P's Mtn. Aff. \u00b6 17).<a note-disclosure=\"13\" href=\"#N196885\"><\/a> Executive Law Article 49\u2013B includes provision for the expungement, upon application, of the records of an individual who \"either voluntarily or pursuant to a warrant or order of a court, has provided a sample for DNA testing in connection with the investigation or prosecution of a crime\" <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-executive\/article-49-b-commission-on-forensic-science-and-establishment-of-dna-identification-index\/section-995-c-state-dna-identification-index\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Exec. Law \u00a7 995\u2013c<\/a>[9][b] ). This provision suggests that it may not have been unforeseen that a forensic DNA laboratory such as OCME might retain DNA profiles of suspects obtained pursuant to pre-conviction court order. Nevertheless, several published trial-level decisions have held that the state statutory scheme does not contemplate OCME's storage of court-ordered pre-conviction suspect profiles in a local index (<i>People v.

Even if the Executive Law does not expressly prohibit the maintenance of a local database, it is difficult for this Court to understand why OCME, as a mere local DNA laboratory, would be denied access to the data in SDIS and yet, solely by artifact of being located in the State's most highly populated city, be permitted access to something like half the DNA evidence in the State of New York, including profiles of unconvicted\u2014and therefore presumptively innocent\u2014individuals (<i>People v.

Mem. of Law at 3d unnumbered page). The unpublished trial-level cases cited by the People (none of which were provided to the Court) appear all to rely on <i>People v. King,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-king-379#p117\" class=\"raw-ref\">232 A.D.2d 111, 117<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-king-379\" class=\"raw-ref\">663 N.Y.S.2d 610<\/a> (2d Dept.1997), in which the Second Department held that once a sample of the defendant's blood had been lawfully obtained pursuant to <i>Abe A.<\/i> , the defendant no longer retained a privacy interest in it, and additional scientific analysis did not involve any further search and seizure of his person (<i>People v. King,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-king-379#p117\" class=\"raw-ref\">232 A.D.2d at 117\u201318<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-king-379\" class=\"raw-ref\">663 N.Y.S.2d 610<\/a> ). However, <i>King<\/i> was decided before the implementation of Article 49\u2013B of the Executive Law, and specifically noted the absence at that time of any \"constitutional provisions or legal precedents concerning the disposition of a blood sample\" such as already existed for fingerprints and arrest photographs (<i>id.<\/i> at 118, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-king-379\" class=\"raw-ref\">663 N.Y.S.2d 610<\/a> [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Furthermore, <i>People v. Sterling,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-sterling-52\" class=\"raw-ref\">57 A.D.3d 1110<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-sterling-52\" class=\"raw-ref\">869 N.Y.S.2d 288<\/a> (3d Dept.2008), an appellate-level case involving comparison with crime scene evidence of a DNA profile from an empty milk carton thrown out by the defendant is inapposite. The Fourth Amendment analysis in the decision turns on the \"abandoned\" status of the milk carton; it simply does not address the statutory protection afforded to a person who has not yet been convicted of a crime against having the profile developed from his court-ordered DNA exemplar retained for future comparisons.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"59\" id=\"pa59\">Similarly, the Court of Appeals decision in <i>People v. DeProspero,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-deprospero-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">20 N.Y.3d 527<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-deprospero-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">964 N.Y.S.2d 487<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-deprospero-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">987 N.E.2d 264<\/a> (2013), does not require a denial of defendants' request for a protective order. As the Court of Appeals observed in upholding a forensic examination of the memory card in defendant's computer for child pornography well after he had pled guilty to a charge based on a single image found in a preliminary search, \"[t]he duration of a warrant's authority is more appropriately measured by the persistence of the cause for its issue\" (<i>id.<\/i> at 532, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-deprospero-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">964 N.Y.S.2d 487<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-deprospero-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">987 N.E.2d 264<\/a> ). Here, however, that cause is only what has been set forth in the People's application relating to this particular investigation. To allow OCME to compare these defendants' DNA profiles to any other crime scene evidence in their possession, now or in the future, <span page-number=\"645\" pagination-id=\"55 N.Y.S.3d 634\" id=\"p645\"><\/span>would vitiate the <i>Abe A.<\/i> requirements that such an order issue only upon a showing of \"probable cause to believe the suspect has committed the crime [and] a clear indication that relevant material evidence will be found\" (<i>Matter of Abe A.,<\/i> l56 N.Y.2d at 291, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">452 N.Y.S.2d 6<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">437 N.E.2d 265<\/a> ). Equally if not more significant is the New York State statutory framework previously discussed. That framework provides that only upon a criminal conviction and sentence is an individual required to provide DNA which, when uploaded to SDIS and CODIS, is then available for general comparison to crime scene evidence in unrelated cases <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-executive\/article-49-b-commission-on-forensic-science-and-establishment-of-dna-identification-index\/section-995-c-state-dna-identification-index\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Exec. Law \u00a7 995\u2013c<\/a> [3], [5], [6] ). Consistent with that statutory scheme, then, this Court's Orders in the two cases before it will permit only circumscribed use of defendants' DNA: the exemplars ordered by this Court may be compared only to the swabs from the gun, the evidence assigned Laboratory Number FB 17\u201300235.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"60\" id=\"pa60\">The police and prosecutors are free to request that OCME compare the DNA profile obtained from the gun swabs in this case and\/or the pseudo-examplar in the Haile case to DNA profiles obtained from crime scenes and evidence in other investigations that OCME maintains in its LDIS. They are also free, following applicable protocols, to request comparison of these evidence profiles with individual DNA profiles of convicted persons that are already in CODIS or in the New York SDIS. If such comparisons yield results consistent with the existence of common contributors, such results may, of course, be used to support an application for a DNA order in connection with the investigation and prosecution of any other crime. For now, however, there is no authority under New York State Law for uploading a presumptively innocent defendant's DNA profile into a database, albeit only a local one (<i>People v.

A to Gruber Aff. in Supp.) describes the nature of this action as follows: <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"17\" id=\"pa17\">  <\/p><blockquote id=\"bq18\" bq-id=\"18\">This action arises from the contractual breaches, misappropriation, deception, dissipation, diversion, waste, conversion and breaches of fiduciary duty and of Defendants' other obligations including those of good faith and fair dealing, by the Defendants' receipt of more than one million dollars of loan proceeds from Plaintiff and retained by all three of the Defendants, and the Defendants' failure and refusal to return the Plaintiff's loan principal and the accumulated interest earned on it, to the Plaintiff, as agreed.<br> <\/blockquote>   <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"19\" id=\"pa19\">Am. Comp. at \u00b6 1. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"20\" id=\"pa20\">Plaintiff alleges that, for a period of time up through December 6, 2007, Plaintiff loaned sums to Defendant totaling $1,024,997.18 (\"Loan\"), The total Loan amount consists of sums that Plaintiff loaned directly to Defendants as well as additional sums that Plaintiff earned on his loans through various investments made by Defendants. Those earnings were automatically rolled over, and added to the sums loaned to Defendants, as part of the Loan, as agreed, and Plaintiff periodically paid substantial additional funds to Defendants. The last of the sums that Plaintiff loaned to Defendants was $100,000, paid on December 6, 2007 by two checks each in the sum of $50,000. All of Plaintiff's dealings with Defendants were through Plaintiff's brother <span page-number=\"3\" pagination-id=\"INDEX NO. 603535\/2013\" id=\"p3\"><\/span> Yehezkel Elia a\/k\/a Hezie Elia (\"Hezie\"), on Plaintiff's behalf. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"21\" id=\"pa21\">Plaintiff sets forth the terms agreed to by the parties with respect to the Loans (Am. Comp. at \u00b6 9). Plaintiff also alleges that, at various times, through and including July 31, 2008, Defendants provided oral and written Loan Summaries and\/or Statements and\/or investment confirmation reports to Plaintiff which confirmed the period increases in the Loan by the rollover of Plaintiff's earnings into the Loan and\/or by the additional sums that Plaintiff received from Defendants. Defendants also advised Plaintiff of loans and investments that Defendants made with the sums provided by Plaintiff. Plaintiff provides descriptions of certain of the written Summaries, Reports or Statements that he received from Defendants in 2006-2008 (<i>see<\/i> Am. Comp. at \u00b6 10). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"22\" id=\"pa22\">Plaintiff alleges that he received not only income and profit rollover acknowledgments from Defendants for sums earned by Plaintiff, which were automatically rolled into the Loan, but also received a $35,000 loan repayment distribution from Defendants on July 9, 2008 towards repayment of the Loan. With the exception of that payment, Defendants have not repaid Plaintiff either the principal, interest or profits due to Plaintiff. In addition, despite Plaintiff's repeated requests, Defendants have not provided Plaintiff with Reports and Accountings since July 31, 2008. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"23\" id=\"pa23\">The Amended Complaint contains ten (10) causes of action: 1) against all Defendants for breach of contract and a request for damages in the amount of $1,024,997.18, together with interest on that sum at 12% per annum from December 6, 2007 to date of payment, less a $35,000 credit for the July 9, 2008 payment, 2) against all Defendants for being faithless servants based on the allegation that Defendants were required to protect the funds borrowed from Plaintiff and failed to do so and should therefore forfeit all of the compensation that they received from the income earned by the funds borrowed from Plaintiff, 3) against all Defendants for conversion of the Loan and the assets and investments earned by Defendants with Plaintiff's funds, for which Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, 4) against all Defendants for money had and received for which Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, 5) against all Defendants under the theory of unjust enrichment for which Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, 6) against all Defendants for breach of fiduciary duty on the theory that Defendants entered into a business relationship with Plaintiff and breached the trust <span page-number=\"4\" pagination-id=\"INDEX NO. 603535\/2013\" id=\"p4\"><\/span> created by that relationship for which Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, 7) for specific performance of the parties' agreements which includes the allegation that Plaintiff does not have an adequate remedy at law, 8) against all Defendants for an accounting which includes the allegation that \"[t]he very nature of the agreements, terms and conditions require a duty to account\" (Am. Comp. at \u00b6 69), 9) a request for the imposition of a constructive trust based on Defendants' alleged failure to advise Plaintiff where the Loan funds have been placed, or to return those funds to Plaintiff, and 10) a request for attorney's fees which includes the allegation that, because Plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages, he is also entitled to attorney's fees in the amount of $50,000. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"24\" id=\"pa24\">In support of the motion now before the Court, counsel for Defendants (\"Defendants' Counsel\") affirms that Plaintiff initiated this action by the filing of a Summons with Notice on November 28, 2013 (Ex. B to Gruber Aff. in Supp.) which was never served. Plaintiff electronically filed his initial complaint on January 16, 2014 and Defendants moved to dismiss the initial complaint. That motion was rendered moot by Plaintiff's service of the Amended Complaint and, accordingly, Defendants withdrew their prior motion to dismiss. Defendants dispute the allegations in the Amended Complaint and submit that all of the causes of action in the Amended Complaint \"suffer from pleading defects which require dismissal of the Complaint\" (Gruber Aff. in Supp. at \u00b6 15), including but not limited to 1) the failure to give notice as to when any of the loans, other than the final two loans, were advanced by Plaintiff, and 2) the fact that the Summons with Notice was filed more than six (6) years after most of the loans were made resulting in those claims being barred by the statute of limitations. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"25\" id=\"pa25\">In opposition, Hezie, the brother of Plaintiff, affirms the truth of the allegations in the Amended Complaint. Hezie provides copies of the two checks in the sum of $50,000, dated December 6, 2007 (Ex. B to Hezie Aff. in Opp.) representing the last sum that Plaintiff loaned to Defendants. With respect to the periodic investment\/loan reports to which the Amended Complaint refers, Hezie affirms that \"[b]y way of example, included as part of Exhibit \"A\" annexed hereto is the October 15, 2007, letter and enclosures from [Perla] and [Soho] to [Plaintiff] regarding Defendants' Green Street Investment...\" (Hezie Aff. in Opp. at \u00b6 17). Exhibit A, however, consists solely of a copy of the Amended Complaint and does not contain any correspondence or enclosures. Hezie affirms that, as asserted in the Amended Complaint, <span page-number=\"5\" pagination-id=\"INDEX NO. 603535\/2013\" id=\"p5\"><\/span> Plaintiff received not only reinvestment credits but also an actual distribution towards repayment of those loans on July 9, 2008. Hezie affirms that, in reviewing records, it was noted that the July 9, 2008 repayment from Defendants was in the amount of $35,000, not $10,000 as asserted in the initial complaint, and was paid by Perla to Jonathan Elia, Hezie's son. Hezie provides a copy of the $35,000 check dated July 9, 2008 payable to Jonathan Elia (Ex. C to Hezie Aff. in Opp.). Hezie affirms the truth of the allegation in the Amended Complaint that, with the exception of the $35,000 payment, Defendants have not repaid Plaintiff his loans or the interest thereon. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"26\" id=\"pa26\">In further opposition to the motion, counsel for Plaintiff (\"Plaintiff's Counsel\") provides the following time line of the allegations in the Amended Complaint: 1) December 6, 2007 was the date of the last of a series of payments or credits that comprised the Loan; 2) July 9, 2008 was the date of the $35,000 loan repayment from Defendants; 3) July 31, 2008 was the date of the last written loan Report\/Accounting from Defendants (Am. Comp. at \u00b6 10(e)); 4) August 2008 was the date of Plaintiff's first demand for repayment of the entire loan (Am. Comp. at \u00b6 15); 5) December 31, 2008 was the date on which Plaintiff's demand required payment from Defendants (Am. Comp. at \u00b6 15); and 6) November 28, 2013 is the date on which Plaintiff filed his Summons with Notice. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"27\" id=\"pa27\">In reply, Defendants note that Plaintiff has submitted an affidavit of Hezie, Plaintiff's brother, but has not provided his own affidavit in opposition to the motion. Defendants submit that Hezie's affidavit does not demonstrate that he has personal knowledge of the relevant facts, or explain Plaintiff's failure to provide an affidavit. Counsel for Defendants affirms that Hezie is a convicted felon as a result of his 2008 conviction for income tax evasion and conspiracy to defraud and was subsequently sentenced and imprisoned from 2008-201 1, as reflected by the documentation provided (Ex. A to Grossman Reply Aff.). Thus, Hezie was incarcerated at the time that, he asserts, he was demanding repayment from Defendants in August 2008 and otherwise handling Plaintiff's transactions with Defendants. Defendants submit that it is \"beyond incredible\" (Grossman Reply Aff. at \u00b66(e)) that Hezie had direct personal involvement or knowledge of the facts surrounding the alleged Loan from 2008-2011. Defendants also note that, although Hezie makes reference in his affidavit to letters or exhibits annexed as Exhibit A, no such documents are contained in Exhibit A. <span page-number=\"6\" pagination-id=\"INDEX NO. 603535\/2013\" id=\"p6\"><\/span> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"28\" id=\"pa28\">C. <u>The Parties' Positions<\/u> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"29\" id=\"pa29\">Defendants submit that where, as here, the nature of the action is for payment of sums of money allegedly owed pursuant to loans and investments that are payable on demand, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of the execution of the demand note\/instrument. Defendants contend that, although the Amended Complaint fails to provide notice of the actual date that Plaintiff advanced any loans, other than the two checks issued on December 6, 2007, it is clear from the allegations that there were multiple loans over a period of time, that the loans were payable, on demand, with three months notice, and that most of the loans were made in 2006 and prior to October 2007. Thus, as the Summons with Notice was not filed until November 28, 2013, all of the alleged demand loans, other than the $100,000 allegedly advanced on December 6, 2007, are barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the first cause of action alleging breach of contract, and the other causes of action arising from those prior loans, including the fourth, fifth, seventh and ninth causes of action, are barred by the statute of limitations. Defendants submit that Plaintiff is on notice of the statute of limitations issues in light of Defendants' prior motion to dismiss the initial complaint. Defendants contend that Plaintiff's failure to set forth the dates of the various loan advances in the Amended Complaint is proof that all, or substantially all, of Plaintiff's claims are time-barred and should be dismissed. Moreover, Plaintiff's allegation that Defendants sent loan summaries\/statements\/investment confirmation reports confirming periodic increases in the Loan, of which Defendants have provided no written proof, is not competent evidence of a new or continuing contract that would take the action out of the statute of limitations. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"30\" id=\"pa30\">Defendants submit further that 1) Plaintiff fails to provide sufficient particularity with respect to the causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty; 2) with respect to the second cause of action for faithless servant, Plaintiff fails to set forth an agency relationship or that Defendants owed Plaintiff a duty of fidelity as a principal; 3) the eighth cause of action, for an accounting, is legally insufficient both because Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged the existence of a fiduciary duty and because Plaintiff has failed, as required, to allege that it made a demand on Defendants for an accounting, and has failed to specify the Defendant(s) on which that demand was made; 4) the ninth cause of action, seeking the imposition of a constructive trust, is legally insufficient because Plaintiff has not pleaded the required elements, including the existence of a confidential <span page-number=\"7\" pagination-id=\"INDEX NO. 603535\/2013\" id=\"p7\"><\/span> or fiduciary relationship; 5) dismissal of the seventh cause of action, for specific performance, is appropriate, in part because, as evidenced by Plaintiff's demands for money damages as to many of the other causes of action, Plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law in the form of money damages; and 6) the Court should dismiss the tenth cause of action, seeking attorney's fees, because Plaintiff has not identified any contract or statute that would entitle him to attorney's fees. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"31\" id=\"pa31\">Plaintiff opposes the motion submitting that, as Defendants were not obligated to return any portion of the Loan to Plaintiff until after at least a three month demand by Plaintiff for repayment, the sums loaned by Plaintiff were not due until December 31, 2008. Plaintiff submits that Defendants' motion fails to take into account <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-civil-practice-law-and-rules\/article-2-limitations-of-time\/section-206-computing-periods-of-limitation-in-particular-actions\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPLR \u00a7 206(a)(2)<\/a> which provides in pertinent part, that \"where there is a deposit of money to be repaid only upon a special demand,... the time within which the action must be commenced shall be computed from the demand for repayment or return.\" As the earliest date that Plaintiff could have made a viable repayment demand was December 6, 2007, for repayment March 6, 2008 (three months later), the six year statute of limitations did not run until March 6, 2014. Plaintiff also argues that the commencement of the statute of limitations period was tolled and extended by either written acknowledgment of the obligation pursuant to General Obligations Law (\"GOL\") \u00b6 17-101, by a partial payment or by misleading representations, all of which occurred in this action as a result of 1) Defendants' last report to Plaintiff on July 31, 2008, 2) Defendants' partial payment to Plaintiff on July 9, 2008 and reports prepared, maintained and sometimes sent by Defendants to Plaintiff, and 3) Defendants' alleged misrepresentations to Plaintiff regarding their intentions, as evidenced by their failure to provide Plaintiff with the requested reports and accounting. Plaintiff also argues that the sums due from Defendants to Plaintiff were converted to a demand note effective December 31, 2008 as a result of Plaintiff's August 2008 demand that Defendants make repayment on that date. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"32\" id=\"pa32\">Plaintiff submits further, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that 1) Plaintiff has adequately pleaded the second cause of action, based on the faithless servant doctrine, by alleging that Defendants assumed a confidential and fiduciary obligation to protect Plaintiff's funds, agreed to keep Plaintiff apprised of the status of the funds on a regular basis, and Defendants misappropriated the Loan funds; 2) Plaintiff has adequately pleaded the sixth cause of action, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, by <span page-number=\"8\" pagination-id=\"INDEX NO. 603535\/2013\" id=\"p8\"><\/span> alleging that Defendants assumed a \"confidential and fiduciary obligation to protect Plaintiff's funds\" (P's Memo. of Law in Opp. at p. 19, quoting Am. Comp. at \u00b6 9(b)), agreed to keep Plaintiff apprised of the status of those funds, were compensated for their efforts and breached that duty when, following Plaintiff's demand for repayment on August 2008, Defendants failed to repay Plaintiff by December 31, 2008; 3) Plaintiff has adequately pleaded the seventh cause of action, for specific performance, by alleging that Defendants failed to honor their agreements, misled and deceived Plaintiff and have refused to account for the Loan funds; 4) Plaintiff has adequately pleaded the eighth cause of action, for an accounting, in part because \"[t]he very nature of the agreements, terms and conditions require a duty to account\" (P's Memo. of Law in Opp. at p. 22), Plaintiff has demanded that Defendants comply with their obligations and accounting, and Defendants have refused to do so; 5) Plaintiff has adequately pleaded the ninth cause of action, for the imposition of a constructive trust, by alleging that Defendants were unjustly enriched by their receipt and retention of funds properly belonging to Plaintiff and that a constructive trust should be imposed in light of Defendants' failure to account for the funds or return the funds to Plaintiff as required; and 6) Plaintiff has adequately pleaded the tenth cause of action, for legal fees, in light of Plaintiff's request for punitive damages in the second through sixth causes of action and case law supporting an award of legal fees where there are \"fraudulent circumstances dictating unusual legal expenditures\" (P's Memo. of Law in Opp. at p. 26, quoting <i>City of Buffalo v<\/i>. <i>J<\/i>.<i>W<\/i>. <i>Clement Co<\/i>., <i>Inc<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/city-of-buffalo-v-clement-co\" class=\"raw-ref\">28 N.Y.2d 241<\/a> (1971)). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"33\" id=\"pa33\">In reply, Defendants submit that 1) although Plaintiff has made reference to numerous writings from Defendants allegedly acknowledging a debt after November 2007, Plaintiff has failed to present any such writings to the Court; 2) Plaintiff has failed to come forward with an affidavit from someone with personal knowledge of the specifics of the alleged Loan; and 3) Plaintiff has failed to specify whether the monies at issue were demand loans, loans of some other type or a series of investments, and has failed to allege precise dates when the sums were advanced to Defendants, other than alleging that the advances happened no later than by October 15, 2007, other than the two final loan checks dated December 6, 2007, totaling $100,000. Under these circumstances, Defendants submit, it is clear that there were multiple loans over a period of time which is supported by Plaintiff's allegation that \"the last of the sums loaned by Plaintiff to Defendants was $100,000\" (Am. Comp. at \u00b6 7). Defendants also contend <span page-number=\"9\" pagination-id=\"INDEX NO. 603535\/2013\" id=\"p9\"><\/span> that there is no affidavit or documentary evidence to support Plaintiff's contention that the sums owed were converted to a demand note effective December 31, 2008, based on an August 2008 demand.

Barrett, J. at search warrant hearing; Martin Marcus, J. at jury trial and sentencing), rendered June 9, 2016, convicting defendant of manslaughter in the first degree, and sentencing him to a term of 25 years, unanimously reversed, on the law, defendant's motion to suppress DNA evidence obtained by way of a search warrant issued on or about January 31, 2012 granted, and the matter remanded for a new trial.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\"> The hearing court improperly precluded defense counsel from reviewing the People's application for a search warrant to obtain a sample of defendant's saliva for DNA purposes and from participating in the substantive portion of the hearing on the application. Defendant had not yet been charged with the homicide at issue, and he was in custody on unrelated charges. Counsel was notified of the search warrant proceeding because he represented defendant in connection with the other charges.<span page-number=\"582\" pagination-id=\"171 A.D.3d 581\" id=\"p582\"><\/span> In general, search warrant applications are made ex parte ( <i>People v.

However, as explained in <i>Matter of Abe A.,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">56 N.Y.2d 288<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">452 N.Y.S.2d 6<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">437 N.E.2d 265<\/a> (1982), special rules apply to evidence to be taken from a suspect's body, such as blood or DNA samples.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\">The hearing court excluded defense counsel based on its understanding that the discussion of notice in <i>Abe A.<\/i> applied only to the first \"discrete level\" of Fourth Amendment analysis identified in that case, involving \"the seizure of the person necessary to bring him into contact with government agents,\" and not the second level, involving \"the subsequent search and seizure for the evidence\" ( <i>id.<\/i> at 295, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">452 N.Y.S.2d 6<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">437 N.E.2d 265<\/a> [internal quotation marks omitted] ). The hearing court ruled that defendant's entitlement to notice of the application to seize his person to \"bring him into contact with government agents\" was satisfied because he was already detained in an unrelated case, and that he was not entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard on the question of whether there was probable cause to support obtaining corporeal evidence from him.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\"> <i>Abe A.<\/i> 's discussion of due process notice consisted of the following: \"At this point it seems appropriate to add, since here there was no exigency, that the course followed by the People on its original application on notice to the suspect was no more than is required by such circumstances. After all, when frustration of the purpose of the application is not at risk, it is an elementary tenet of due process that the target of the application be afforded the opportunity to be heard in opposition before his or her constitutional right to be left alone may be infringed\" ( <i>id.<\/i> at 296, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">452 N.Y.S.2d 6<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">437 N.E.2d 265<\/a> [citations omitted] ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\">We agree with defendant that the mere fact that the <i>Abe A.<\/i> court placed its pronouncement regarding notice in the midst of its discussion of the first level of intrusion at issue there does not establish that the principle announced applied only to that first level. Nothing in the Court's opinion suggests a basis for applying the \"elementary tenet of due process\" described by the Court only to the first part of an application for an order to physically detain a person and then make a corporeal search. Considering <i>Abe A.<\/i> as a whole, <span page-number=\"259\" pagination-id=\"99 N.Y.S.3d 257\" id=\"p259\"><\/span>we cannot agree with the warrant court's conclusion that it contained what the People refer to as a \"bifurcated holding\" regarding notice. Accordingly, defendant is entitled to suppression of the DNA evidence obtained as a result of the warrant issued by the hearing court, and a new trial (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v. Fomby<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-fomby-11#p30\" class=\"raw-ref\">103 A.D.3d 28, 30<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-fomby-11\" class=\"raw-ref\">956 N.Y.S.2d 633<\/a> [3d Dept. 2012], <i>lv denied<\/i> 21 N.Y.3d 1015, 971 N.Y.S.2d 497, 994 N.E.2d 393 [2013] ).

The authentication testimony was essentially limited to testimony that the video shown in court was the same as the one posted on YouTube and another website, and that defendant appears in the video. Accordingly, there was no authentication under any of the methods discussed in <i>Price<\/i> .<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\">Because we are ordering a new trial, we find it unnecessary to reach defendant's remaining contentions other than to find that the verdict was supported by legally sufficient evidence and was not against the weight of the evidence.

Defendant failed to preserve his claim that the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop a car in which he was a passenger ( <i>see People v Davis<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-davis-1348\" class=\"raw-ref\">233 AD2d 148<\/a>, <i>lv denied<\/i> 89 NY2d 941; <i>see also People v Colon<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-colon-180#p263\" class=\"raw-ref\">46 AD3d 260, 263<\/a>). Defendant likewise failed to preserve his claim that the procedure by which the People obtained a search warrant to retrieve information from his cell phone was unconstitutional ( <i>see People v Iannelli<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-iannelli-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">69 NY2d 684<\/a>, <i>cert denied<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/griffin-v-hilke\" class=\"raw-ref\">482 US 914<\/a>). We decline to review either of these claims in the interest of justice. As an alternate holding, we reject both claims on the merits. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"8\" id=\"pa8\"> When the police stopped the car in which defendant was riding, they clearly had reasonable suspicion that defendant, along with the driver and other persons, had just taken part in a large drug transaction. This was based on a long-term investigation, including surveillance and eavesdropping, that led to a chain of circumstantial evidence justifying the stop of the car. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"9\" id=\"pa9\"> The police took custody of a cell phone that defendant was carrying at the time of his arrest. While this case was pending <span page-number=\"694\" pagination-id=\"85 A.D.3d 693\" id=\"p694\"><\/span> in Supreme Court, the police obtained a search warrant to retrieve information from the phone. The ex parte procedure was lawful, since the target of a search warrant has no right to notice or an opportunity to be heard on the application ( <i>see<\/i> CPL art 690; <i>Matter of Albany County Dept. of Social Servs. v Rossi<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/albany-county-dept-of-social-serv-v-rossi#p1050\" class=\"raw-ref\">62 AD3d 1049, 1050<\/a>).

{"type":"case","document":"<section class=\"document-text serif\" id=\"caseBodyHtml\"> <section class=\"introduction\"> <p class=\"date\"> December 10, 1996. <\/p> <div class=\"posture\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"2\" id=\"pa2\"> Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Allen Alpert, J.), entered February 26, 1996, which granted the motion by defendants (charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second and third degrees, criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree and unlawful <span page-number=\"75\" pagination-id=\"234 A.D.2d 74\" id=\"p75\"><\/span> possession of marijuana) to suppress physical evidence seized from an apartment pursuant to warrant, unanimously reversed, on the law, the motion is denied, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings. <\/p> <\/div> <div class=\"judicial-panel\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"3\" id=\"pa3\"> Before: Rosenberger, J.P., Wallach, Kupferman, Nardelli and Mazzarelli, JJ. <\/p> <\/div> <\/section><hr> <section class=\"decision opinion\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"4\" id=\"pa4\"> In preparing to assist in the execution of a search warrant at Apartment 3B in a building on Alexander Avenue in the Bronx, one of two police officers staked out in the hallway heard a commotion and the words \"They're coming, get out of here\" emanating from Apartment 3C across the hall. Three men then hurriedly exited the latter apartment and ran down the hallway toward the plainclothes police. When the officers identified themselves, one of the men dropped a heavy plastic shopping bag in which were visible several softball-sized bundles wrapped in paper. Two of the men were detained (the third ran back to Apartment 3C and was admitted after banging on the door), and the shopping bag was determined to contain numerous vials of crack cocaine. One of the men offered that there was a quantity of marijuana in the apartment (3C) from which they had just emerged. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"5\" id=\"pa5\"> Apartment 3B proved to be vacant. Based in part on an affidavit by one of the officers in the hallway, a warrant was obtained to search Apartment 3C. The search the next day yielded more than 1,000 vials of crack cocaine, drug paraphernalia, marijuana and $2,000 in cash, leading to the indictment of defendants herein. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"6\" id=\"pa6\"> The supporting affidavit for the warrant to search Apartment 3C stated in part that the officer had heard <i>one of the trio exiting the apartment<\/i> \"verbalizing that the police were coming.\" Limiting its review to \"the four corners of the search warrant affidavit,\" the suppression court found no probable cause because the pertinent portion of the officer's affidavit varied materially from his later testimony that some <i>unidentified<\/i> voice had yelled <i>from inside the apartment<\/i>: \"They're coming, get out of here.\" <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"7\" id=\"pa7\"> While the language of the officer's affidavit did vary from that of his later testimony, the variance was insignificant and its impact was not decisive, especially in light of the police observation of physical evidence in possession of those having just emerged from the apartment in question. Both versions pointed to the same consciousness of guilt \u2014 that something illegal was transpiring inside Apartment 3C. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"8\" id=\"pa8\"> A presumption of validity attaches to a warrant, which has already been tested by the issuing Judge, thus simplifying the suppression court's task to determining whether the issuing Judge could reasonably have concluded that probable cause <span page-number=\"76\" pagination-id=\"234 A.D.2d 74\" id=\"p76\"><\/span> existed ( <i>People v Castillo<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-castillo-161#p585\" class=\"raw-ref\">80 NY2d 578, 585<\/a>, <i>cert denied<\/i> 507 US 1033). The proper way to challenge that conclusion is for defendants to prove, at a hearing, that the issuance of the warrant was based solely on an intentionally or recklessly false statement made under oath ( <i>Franks v Delaware<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/franks-v-delaware\" class=\"raw-ref\">438 US 154<\/a>). Short of holding such a hearing, a search warrant can only be controverted for lack of probable cause, i.e., insufficiency of information to support a reasonable belief that evidence of criminal activity would be found in the subject apartment upon execution of the warrant ( <i>People v Bigelow<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-bigelow-3#p423\" class=\"raw-ref\">66 NY2d 417, 423<\/a>; <i>People v Munoz<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-munoz-68\" class=\"raw-ref\">205 AD2d 452<\/a>, <i>lv denied<\/i> 84 NY2d 870).

While Brian Watkins was the only fatality, the other members of his family were either slashed, or kicked and beaten by the group of teenagers who committed these atrocities in order to obtain money to go dancing at Roseland. The defendant was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the murder. On direct appeal, Nova's conviction was affirmed by order of this Court entered November 30, 1993 <i>(People v. Nova<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-nova-9\" class=\"raw-ref\">198 A.D.2d 193<\/a>, <i>lv denied<\/i> 83 N.Y.2d 808). By motion dated September 8, 1993, Nova moved, pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-m-proceedings-after-judgment\/article-440-post-judgment-motions\/section-44010-motion-to-vacate-judgment\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 440.10<\/a>, for an order vacating the judgment of conviction on the ground that an audiotape made by the pathologist during the autopsy of Brian Watkins' body constituted <i>Rosario<\/i> material <i>(see, People v. Rosario<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-rosario-213\" class=\"raw-ref\">9 N.Y.2d 286<\/a>; <i>see also<\/i>, <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-240-discovery\/section-24045-repealed-discovery-upon-trial-of-prior-statements-and-criminal-history-of-witnesses\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 240.45<\/a> [a]), and that the failure to disclose the tape required reversal and a new trial pursuant to <i>People v. Ranghelle<\/i> ( <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-ranghelle-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">69 N.Y.2d 56<\/a>). By order of Supreme Court, New York County (Edwin Torres, J.), entered October 13, 1993, that motion was denied. Permission to appeal that order was granted by a Justice of this Court. For the following reasons we unanimously affirm the October 13, 1993 order and hold that the audiotape in question is not <i>Rosario<\/i> material. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"7\" id=\"pa7\"> In <i>People v. Rosario (supra<\/i>, at 289), it was held that a \"right sense of justice\" requires that the prosecution turn over to the defense any statement made by a prosecution witness to the police, District Attorney or Grand Jury that relates to the subject matter of the witness' testimony. Since <i>People v Ranghelle (supra)<\/i>, it has been the law in this State that the <span page-number=\"134\" pagination-id=\"206 A.D.2d 132\" id=\"p134\"><\/span> People's complete failure to provide <i>Rosario<\/i> material to the defense constitutes per se reversible error requiring a new trial <i>(People v. Martinez<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-martinez-391#p940\" class=\"raw-ref\">71 N.Y.2d 937, 940<\/a>; <i>see, People v. Jones<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-jones-827\" class=\"raw-ref\">70 N.Y.2d 547<\/a>; <i>People v. Perez<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-perez-950\" class=\"raw-ref\">65 N.Y.2d 154<\/a>). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"8\" id=\"pa8\"> However, it has been consistently held by the Court of Appeals that the People's obligation to produce the pretrial statements of their witnesses is limited to material which is in their possession or control <i>(People v. Flynn<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-flynn-46#p882\" class=\"raw-ref\">79 N.Y.2d 879, 882<\/a>). Traditionally, documents in the possession of law enforcement agencies have been deemed to be in the constructive possession of the People and are required to be produced. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"9\" id=\"pa9\"> For example, in <i>People v. Ranghelle (supra)<\/i>, the failure to turn over a precinct complaint report containing a synopsis of the complainant's allegations against the defendant, before the close of the evidence, was held to be per se reversible error. The Court noted that the existence of a complaint report filed with the police was readily available to the People and held that, \"the burden of locating and producing prior statements of complaining witnesses, filed with police agencies, remain[s] solely with the People\" <i>(People v. Ranghelle, supra<\/i>, at 64). In <i>People v. Fields<\/i> ( <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-fields-159\" class=\"raw-ref\">146 A.D.2d 505<\/a>), this Court held that the notes of a parole officer constituted <i>Rosario<\/i> material, which the People were required to produce. In holding that a parole officer was a member of law enforcement it was noted that, \"a parole officer is a peace officer with the power to take such action as making warrantless arrests, using physical and deadly force in executing an arrest or preventing an escape, carrying out constitutionally permissible warrantless searches, and possessing and taking custody of firearms not owned by the peace officer for the purpose of disposing or guarding such firearms [citation omitted]\" <i>(supra<\/i>, at 508). It was also noted that the parole officer's function of determining if parole violation charges are to be filed against a person in order that he or she may be sent back to prison is \"certainly a prosecutorial function\" <i>(supra<\/i>, at 508-509). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\"> Defendant, herein, raises the same arguments as were raised and rejected by the Second Department in <i>People v. Washington<\/i> ( <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-washington-501\" class=\"raw-ref\">196 A.D.2d 346<\/a>, <i>lv granted<\/i> 83 N.Y.2d 1008). Here, as in <i>Washington<\/i>, the defendant bases his argument that the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) performs \"prosecutorial functions\" on the facts that the New York City Charter and the New York City Administrative Code require the OCME to make certain determinations regarding the cause of death (NY City Charter \u00a7 557 [f]; Administrative Code <span page-number=\"135\" pagination-id=\"206 A.D.2d 132\" id=\"p135\"><\/span> \u00a7\u00a7 17-203, 17-205), and to maintain certain records and provide same to law enforcement and the prosecutor's office (NY City Charter \u00a7 557 [g]; Administrative Code \u00a7 17-205). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\"> However, upon our review of these Charter and Administrative Code provisions, we conclude, in accordance with <i>People v Washington (supra)<\/i>, that the OCME is neither an agency of law enforcement, nor in any manner under the control of the local prosecutors' offices. Pursuant to New York City Charter \u00a7 557 (a) and (c), the OCME was created as an independent agency affiliated for administrative purposes with the Department of Health of the City of New York. The Medical Examiners who staff OCME are doctors who are qualified as pathologists and microscopists. Unlike the officers of the State Division of Parole, they are not peace officers and do not have any of the powers of peace officers. \"[T]he principal function of OCME is to officially determine the cause of death when death occurs under any one of several distinct circumstances, i.e., 'from criminal violence, by casualty, by suicide, suddenly when in apparent health, when unattended by a physician, in a correctional facility or in any suspicious or unusual manner' (NY City Charter \u00a7 557 [f]; <i>see also<\/i>, Administrative Code of City of N Y \u00a7\u00a7 17-201, 17-203)\" <i>(People v. Washington, supra<\/i>, at 350). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\"> It is required that the OCME deliver to the District Attorney copies of all records relating to every death as to which there is, in the judgment of the medical examiner in charge, any indication of criminality (NY City Charter \u00a7 557 [g]). This requirement to furnish information does not place the OCME under the control of the prosecutor's office for the purposes of <i>Rosario (supra)<\/i> or for any other purposes. It has been noted that nothing in the Charter or Administrative Code requires the OCME to make or retain audio tapes of autopsies. Further, the District Attorney has no control over the form of the records kept by the OCME or over which records are provided to it <i>(see, People v. Washington, supra<\/i>, at 351). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\"> There is nothing unique in this arrangement. Numerous other governmental agencies are required to provide reports to the District Attorney. For example: the Board of Elections must refer a matter to the District Attorney and make its files available if it believes a criminal violation has occurred <i>(see<\/i>, <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-election\/article-3-election-officials\/title-1-statewide-provisions\/section-3-104-state-board-of-elections-enforcement-powers\" class=\"raw-ref\">Election Law \u00a7 3-104<\/a>); the director of a facility under the jurisdiction of the Offices of Mental Health is obligated by law to report crimes to the District Attorney and, upon consent of the appropriate Commissioner, the clinical records of patients <span page-number=\"136\" pagination-id=\"206 A.D.2d 132\" id=\"p136\"><\/span> in mental health facilities must be provided to the District Attorney's office when necessary to the furtherance of a criminal investigation of patient abuse <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-mental-hygiene\/title-b-mental-health-act\/article-7-office-of-mental-health\/section-721-directors-of-facilities\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 7.21<\/a> [b]; \u00a7 33.13 [c] [9] [vi]); and the Superintendent of Insurance must report fraud to the District Attorney <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-insurance\/article-4-insurance-frauds-prevention\/section-405-reports\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Insurance Law \u00a7 405<\/a>). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\"> In <i>People v. Flynn (supra)<\/i>, the Court of Appeals rejected the defendant's argument that a motor vehicle accident report filed by the complainant with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) was <i>Rosario<\/i> material. The defendant's argument in <i>Flynn<\/i> was based on the fact that the DMV performs some law enforcement functions and is involved in the adjudication of offenses resulting in fines and license revocations. The Court explicitly held that \"[m]aterial in the possession of a State administrative agency, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles, is not within the control of a local prosecutor\" <i>(People v. Flynn, supra<\/i>, at 882). While it was not stated by the Court in <i>Flynn<\/i>, it is relevant to note that DMV investigators are designated as peace officers <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-a-short-title-applicability-and-definitions\/article-2-peace-officers\/section-210-persons-designated-as-peace-officers\" class=\"raw-ref\">(CPL 2.10<\/a>). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"15\" id=\"pa15\"> If the requirement that records be made available to the District Attorney's office, upon its request, were deemed to render such records under the \"control\" of the local prosecutor for <i>Rosario<\/i> purposes, then virtually every record in the possession of any City agency would be deemed to be under such control, since <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-county\/article-24-provisions-applicable-to-new-york-city\/section-932-exemption-of-district-attorneys-from-payment-of-certain-fees\" class=\"raw-ref\">County Law \u00a7 932<\/a> provides District Attorneys with the right to obtain a copy of any record in any City agency. <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-county\/article-24-provisions-applicable-to-new-york-city\/section-932-exemption-of-district-attorneys-from-payment-of-certain-fees\" class=\"raw-ref\">Section 932 County<\/a> of the County Law provides, in pertinent part, that every salaried officer of the City of New York and the counties it comprises \"must, upon application therefor, furnish to the district attorney of any of the said counties, a certified or exemplified copy or transcript of, or extract from, or transcript of any writing, paper, record or document on file or recorded in his office, or of the return upon an execution, mandate or order, without the payment of any fee or charge whatsoever therefor\". Clearly, neither the functions of the OCME as defined by the Charter and Administrative Code, not the requirements that it refer matters to the District Attorneys or provide their offices with its findings and other information, can be viewed as \"prosecutorial functions\" bringing the OCME under the control of local prosecutors. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"16\" id=\"pa16\"> We intimated as much in <i>People v. Santiago<\/i> ( <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-santiago-4\" class=\"raw-ref\">200 A.D.2d 370<\/a>, <i>lv denied<\/i> 83 N.Y.2d 876). In that case, this Court held that the failure to preserve a blanket in which the deceased's body was <span page-number=\"137\" pagination-id=\"206 A.D.2d 132\" id=\"p137\"><\/span> found wrapped \"was attributable to the Medical Examiner's Office, not law enforcement personnel\" <i>(supra).<\/i> Moreover, the Second Circuit in <i>United States v. Rosa<\/i> ( <a href=\"\/case\/us-v-rosa-4\" class=\"raw-ref\">11 F.3d 315<\/a>, <i>cert denied<\/i> ___ US ___, 114 S Ct 1565) held that <a href=\"\/statute\/united-states-code\/title-28-appendix\/federal-rules-of-evidence\/article-viii-hearsay\/rule-803-exceptions-to-the-rule-against-hearsay-regardless-of-whether-the-declarant-is-available-as-a-witness\" class=\"raw-ref\">rule 803 (8) of the Federal Rules of Evidence<\/a>, which provides, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that reports prepared by law enforcement personnel are not admissible at trial, did not apply to a written autopsy report prepared by an employee of the OCME. In <i>United States v. Rosa<\/i>, the Second Circuit noted that while it had previously held in <i>United States v. Oates<\/i> ( <a href=\"\/case\/united-states-v-oates-3\" class=\"raw-ref\">560 F.2d 45<\/a> [2d Cir 1977]) that chemists employed by United States Customs Service were \"'law enforcement personnel'\" for the purposes of <a href=\"\/statute\/united-states-code\/title-28-appendix\/federal-rules-of-evidence\/article-viii-hearsay\/rule-803-exceptions-to-the-rule-against-hearsay-regardless-of-whether-the-declarant-is-available-as-a-witness\" class=\"raw-ref\">rule 803 (8) (B)<\/a>, it was \"not persuaded that the term 'law enforcement personnel' as used in <a href=\"\/statute\/united-states-code\/title-28-appendix\/federal-rules-of-evidence\/article-viii-hearsay\/rule-803-exceptions-to-the-rule-against-hearsay-regardless-of-whether-the-declarant-is-available-as-a-witness\" class=\"raw-ref\">Rule 803 (8) (B)<\/a> should be read to encompass employees of the Medical Examiner's Office\" ( <a href=\"\/case\/us-v-rosa-4#p332\" class=\"raw-ref\">11 F.3d 315, 332<\/a>, <i>supra).<\/i> It was stated therein: \"Unlike Customs, which has responsibility for enforcement of, <i>inter alia<\/i>, customs and narcotics laws, <i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/regulation\/code-of-federal-regulations\/title-19-customs-duties\/chapter-i-us-customs-and-border-protection-department-of-homeland-security-department-of-the-treasury\/part-161-general-enforcement-provisions\/section-1610-scope\" class=\"raw-ref\">19 C.F.R. \u00a7 161.0<\/a>, <a href=\"\/regulation\/code-of-federal-regulations\/title-19-customs-duties\/chapter-i-us-customs-and-border-protection-department-of-homeland-security-department-of-the-treasury\/part-161-general-enforcement-provisions\/subpart-a-general-provisions\/section-1612-enforcement-for-other-agencies\" class=\"raw-ref\">161.2<\/a> (1993), the Medical Examiner's Office is required simply to investigate unnatural deaths; it refers a death bearing any indicium of criminality to the appropriate district attorney and has no responsibility for enforcing any laws, <i>see<\/i>, N Y City Charter Ch. 22 \u00a7 557 ('Charter'). The chief medical examiner and his assistants are required to be physicians and pathologists; there is no requirement in the Charter that they be attorneys or that any employees of the office have any law enforcement training. Even when a matter is referred to the district attorney because of an indication of criminality, the Charter does not give the medical examiner any responsibility for collecting evidence or determining the identity of the perpetrator. * * * [A] medical examiner's reported observations as to a body's condition are normally made as part of an independent effort to determine a cause of death.

The defendant's dismissal motion rests upon two arguments:<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\">That the People's February 8, 2017, declaration of non-readiness for trial, based upon the prosecutor's intention of obtaining medical records, renders illusory all previous declarations of readiness; and<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\">That the accusatory instrument was not converted to an information until the People filed and served a valid certificate of translation attesting that the document was translated to the complainant.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\">The People, by written response, oppose the defendant's motion.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\">This Court first addresses the defendant's two legal arguments, followed by an analysis of the \"30.30 clock\" in light of these legal determinations.<\/p> <h3>Part I<\/h3> <h3>The People's Announcement of Non-Readiness for the Purpose of Obtaining Medical Records Does Not Render Previous Declarations of Readiness Illusory Per Se Pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">C.P.L \u00a7 30.30<\/a> <\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"17\" id=\"pa17\"> The defendant argues that the procedural history of this case tracks that of <i>People v.

The <i>Sibblies<\/i> Court found unanimously that the off calendar CoR was rendered illusory by the People's subsequent admission of non-readiness.

Off-calendar, on August 26, 2016, the People filed and served a supporting deposition of the complainant. Subsequently, on January 27, 2017, the People filed and served a superseding information signed by the complainant and accompanied by a certificate <span page-number=\"419\" pagination-id=\"66 N.Y.S.3d 415\" id=\"p419\"><\/span>of translation (\"CoT\") attesting that an interpreter with the AT &amp; T Language Line Interpretation Service translated the superseding information into Polish for the complainant. No such CoT was filed with the initial accusatory instrument.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"25\" id=\"pa25\">The original accusatory instrument alleged that the defendant committed assault in the third degree and harassment in the second degree against the complainant by \"punch[ing] and kick[ing] him about the face and body causing bruises to his face and body.\" Via the supporting deposition, the complainant attested, under the penalty of perjury, that the allegations against the defendant attributed to him in the accusatory instrument were in fact true.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"26\" id=\"pa26\">However, in later filing a CoT along with a superseding information, the People conceded their actual knowledge, and constructive knowledge since the start of this prosecution, that the complainant was incapable of confirming the veracity and accuracy of the English-written, hearsay allegations attributed to him in the accusatory instrument without the benefit of a Polish translation.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"27\" id=\"pa27\">Moreover, <i>Rosario<\/i> documents further substantiate the fact that the complainant was reliant upon a Polish translation, namely,<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"28\" id=\"pa28\">Complainant is described on the NYPD Omniform Complaints Sheet as \"not proficient in English,\" Polish speaking and requiring translation; and<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"29\" id=\"pa29\">Complainant is listed on certified records of Wyckoff Heights Medical Center as Polish speaking and requiring an interpreter service to sign an acknowledgement form while being treated.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"30\" id=\"pa30\">That these <i>Rosario<\/i> documents were provided by the prosecution to the defendant underscores the People's constructive knowledge of the complainant's lack of proficiency in English.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"31\" id=\"pa31\">\"A misdemeanor complaint authorizes jurisdiction over an accused, and can commence a criminal action ..., but it cannot serve as a basis for prosecution, unless the defendant waives prosecution by information.

In this case, where the complainant is clearly non-English speaking and the People knew that translation was necessary to provide him the opportunity to learn exactly what accusations were being made in his name, but failed to file a CoT, every allegation of the initial accusatory instrument was hearsay.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"32\" id=\"pa32\">The People, in response, describe a CoT as \"not necessary for the complaint to be deemed an information\" and argue that \"whether the signing witness understood the complaint due to a language barrier or any other reason is an issue for cross-examination at trial.\" People'<a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">s 30.30<\/a> Response at 4. However, this argument overlooks the defendant's affirmative evidence and the People's admission, through the subsequent filing of a CoT, that the complainant lacked such understanding without the aid of a Polish interpreter. The prosecutor's work in creating a superseding document, interacting with the complainant via a telephonic Polish interpreter <span page-number=\"420\" pagination-id=\"66 N.Y.S.3d 415\" id=\"p420\"><\/span>to ensure his complete understanding of, and agreement with, the accusations made against the defendant, and creating a CoT to memorialize this effort directly belie the People's current attempt to minimize this undertaking.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"33\" id=\"pa33\">Further, cases cited by the People undercut their stance. For example, in <i>People v. Benitez<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-benitez-69\" class=\"raw-ref\">15 Misc. 3d 1122<\/a>(A), 2007 WL 1139420 (Crim. Ct., Kings Co. 2007), the court opined that \"if, during the pre-trial stage of a criminal proceeding, a court is presented with unchallenged indicia of a complaining witness' lack of understanding and ability to speak or read English, the verifications by that complaining witness on the corroborating affidavit would become immediately suspect.\" <i>Id.<\/i> at *2. The case <i>sub judice<\/i> involves exactly this issue of a corroborating affidavit rendered \"immediately suspect\" by the \"unchallenged indicia,\" demonstrated by <i>Rosario<\/i> documents and the People's later filing of a CoT, that the complainant could not understand the English-written accusatory instrument unaided. <i>Compare also<\/i> <i>People v.

The defendant now challenges the People's certificate of compliance and statement of readiness dated January 24, 2020, on the grounds that the People's disclosure was insufficient and not proper. Upon oral argument, and a review of the relevant documents\/items in dispute, email exchanges between the parties, and the People's written response to the defendant's demands, for the following reasons and with the additional discovery ordered as set forth in the following decision, the People's Certificate of Compliance and Statement of Readiness dated January 24, 2020 is deemed valid.<\/p> <h3>The Parties Duty to Diligently Confer with Each Other<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\"> Pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24535-court-ordered-procedures-to-facilitate-compliance\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.35<\/a>, the Parties are ordered to diligently confer with each other to reach an accommodation as to any dispute prior to seeking a ruling from the court. To that end, prior to the oral argument held on January 30, 2020, the parties were required to discuss any discovery disputes in order to resolve any outstanding issues. Going forward, the parties are reminded of their obligation to confer with each other to reach a resolution prior to seeking judicial intervention.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\"> <i> <b>Contact Information Properly Disclosed<\/b> <\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\"> Pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24520-automatic-discovery\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.20(1)(c)<\/a>, the People are required to turn over the names and \"adequate contact information\" for the witnesses they intend to call at trial. The People, as part of their automatic disclosure, have provided the names and personal email addresses of said witnesses to the defendant.<a note-disclosure=\"1\" href=\"#N196644\"><\/a> The defendant alleges, despite not having attempted to reach <span page-number=\"921\" pagination-id=\"66 Misc. 3d 918\" id=\"p921\"><\/span> any witnesses in this case, that such information is insufficient and demands telephone numbers and\/or better contact information. <\/p><div note-container=\"1\" id=\"N196644\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"15\" id=\"pa15\"> The People affirmed that they received the current email addresses directly from their witnesses and further affirmed that they have encouraged their witnesses to acknowledge receipt of any contact by the defense by email, regardless of whether or not the witness wishes to speak with the defense.<\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"16\" id=\"pa16\"> <i>The Court finds that the People have properly met their burden in providing adequate contact information for the witnesses they intend to call at trial. In the year 2020, where electronic communication is widely used and available, e-mail addresses for the witnesses provides an appropriate balance between the defendant's rights to meaningful discovery in order to defend against the crimes for which he\/she is accused, and the privacy rights of victims and witnesses to crimes. Moreover, it cannot be reasonably inferred that the legislature intended the statute to <\/i> <span page-number=\"835\" pagination-id=\"119 N.Y.S.3d 831\" id=\"p835\"><\/span> <i>require that the People provide such personal information (i.e. home, cellular or work telephone numbers) for all civilian witnesses.<\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"17\" id=\"pa17\"> <i> <b>Electronic Audio Recordings<\/b> <\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"18\" id=\"pa18\"> Pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24520-automatic-discovery\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.20(1)(g)<\/a>, the People are required to disclose, within 15 days of a defendant's arraignment, any tapes or electronic recordings in its possession that they intend to use at trial. In the instant case, the People have provided, among other forms of electronic communications, approximately 200 electronic recordings of calls made by the defendant while housed at a facility operated by the New York City Department of Correction (\"Rikers calls\"), with a general statement that, at this stage of the case, they intend to seek to introduce all recordings, subject to admissibility issues. The People have further asserted that due to the voluminous nature of said calls, it would not be possible or reasonable in the time restraints of <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24510-timing-of-discovery\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.10(1)(a)<\/a>, for them to be able to narrow down the exact calls, if any, they intend to use at trial. The defendant argues that this is insufficient under the statute.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"19\" id=\"pa19\">While not expressly stated on the record it appears that the People are seeking a modification pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24570-protective-orders\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.70(2)<\/a>, which allows the court to alter the time periods for discovery imposed upon a showing of good cause. In the instant case, such good cause has been met. Here, there are close to 200 Rikers calls provided and it would be next to impossible for them to be reviewed in order to determine which they would actually seek to introduce at trial within the time restraints required by the statute. As such, the time period in which to <span page-number=\"922\" pagination-id=\"66 Misc. 3d 918\" id=\"p922\"><\/span> identify which of these approximately 200 Rikers calls they will seek to introduce at trial is modified and the People are ordered to provide a list of specific Rikers calls they will seek to introduce, if any, at least 30 days prior to the first scheduled trial date.<a note-disclosure=\"2\" href=\"#N196681\"><\/a> It is further ordered that this delay in disclosure does not effect the People's certificate of compliance and statement of readiness dated January 24, 2020. <\/p><div note-container=\"2\" id=\"N196681\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"20\" id=\"pa20\"> The Court is aware that additional Rikers calls may become available and all of those calls, should be provided to defense counsel as soon as they are received, and in accordance with this Order.<\/p> <\/div> <h3>Notes On the Envelope Containing the \"cigarette butt\" Vouchered as Evidence<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"22\" id=\"pa22\"> During the compliance conference, the defendant alleged that the People failed to turn over, as part of their automatic discovery, a copy of the envelope used to store evidence recovered in this case, which purportedly contains markings or notes from the officer that vouchered the evidence. In response, the People state that they have provided a copy of an inventory sheet which details the markings, but not the note itself, as no copy was readily available and the property was vouchered and placed in the evidence locker.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"23\" id=\"pa23\"> <i>Since the new law favors disclosure of evidence, and without seeing the actual envelope or a copy thereof, there is no way of knowing what is exactly written on the envelope, disclosure of the envelope is required. Accordingly, the People are ordered to either provide a copy of the envelope, or allow the defendant, through counsel, to inspect the actual envelope at the next court date or at a mutually convenient time to be agreed to by the parties. However, while this document needs to be provided to the defense, since there is no evidence that the People acted in bad faith and have provided an inventory sheet detailing the markings, which appear to only be voucher and\/or case numbers, such failure does not warrant a finding that the People's Certificate of Compliance was illusory.<\/i> <span page-number=\"836\" pagination-id=\"119 N.Y.S.3d 831\" id=\"p836\"><\/span> <i> <b>\"LIMS\" Bench Notes, Computer System and Audit Trail<\/b> <\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"24\" id=\"pa24\">During the compliance conference, the defendant alleged that the People failed to turn over, as part of their automatic discovery, a copy of the laboratory information management system (\"LIMS\") Audit trail from the New York City Office Of Chief Medical Examiner's (\"OCME\") LIMS computer system regarding the DNA evidence in which the People intend to introduce at trial, as well as any \"bench notes\" not previously <span page-number=\"923\" pagination-id=\"66 Misc. 3d 918\" id=\"p923\"><\/span> turned over. The People counter that OCME is not under their \"control\" for purposes of automatic discovery purposes and, in any event, do not have, nor are they aware, whether such documentation exists. Since the last court date, the defendant has clarified his request and has now asked for a copy of the entire LIMS computer system, as well as the bench notes and audit trail. (<i>See<\/i> emails attached to People's reply to instant motion).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"25\" id=\"pa25\"> As a preliminary matter, because the OCME performed DNA analysis in this case at the request of either the New York City Police Department or the Queens County District Attorney's office, and not because they were under some statutory duty to do so, the data requested by the Defense pertaining to this DNA analysis is discoverable pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24520-automatic-discovery\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.20(1)(j)<\/a>.

Although the statutory framework set forth in VTL \u00a7 1192 is substance specific, the critical difference in the treatment of alcohol and drugs set forth in the statute is the degree of impairment required for one to be guilty of a misdemeanor, to wit: the level of impairment required to be guilty of a misdemeanor for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of drugs is less than that for alcohol. That is, to be guilty of a misdemeanor for driving under the influence of drugs, one's ability to operate a motor vehicle must merely be \"impaired\".

Inasmuch as the only confirmation that the substance referred to in the accusatory instrument that is the subject of the motion before this Court are prohibited drugs is the officer's opinion based on his training and experience (i.e., there is no admission by the defendant, no laboratory report, or written opinion of a DRE), the defendant argues that the accusatory instrument must be dismissed as facially insufficient. Defense Affirmation, pg. 6. The court does not agree.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"28\" id=\"pa28\">In support of the motion, the defendant relies, inter alia, upon <i>People v. Ortiz,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-ortiz-813\" class=\"raw-ref\">6 Misc.3d 1024<\/a>(A), 2004 WL 3196950 (Crim.Ct., Bronx County 2004) which involved two accusatory instruments\u2014the first filed at arraignment, and the second, a superseding information filed after the time set forth in the speedy trial statute had <span page-number=\"847\" pagination-id=\"27 N.Y.S.3d 841\" id=\"p847\"><\/span> expired. The first of these accusatory instruments provided that the officer observed the defendant to have glassy bloodshot eyes, was staring into space, was unable to stand, and was unresponsive. No drugs were alleged to have been found with the defendant in the car and <span page-number=\"218\" pagination-id=\"52 Misc. 3d 212\" id=\"p218\"><\/span> that accusatory instrument was served and filed without a lab report. The People served and filed the second superseding information, together with a lab report which showed the presence of Phencyclidine (PCP) in the defendant's blood. The defendant moved to dismiss arguing that accusatory instrument was facially insufficient. Because the second accusatory instrument was filed after the speedy trial statute period had expired, the court did not consider it, and, upon reviewing the first accusatory instrument, expressed significant concern as to the identification of the specific drug which allegedly had been ingested by the defendant\u2014i.e., whether the drug allegedly ingested by the defendant was in fact proscribed by the statute. More specifically, the court noted \"barring defendant's admission, only a laboratory analysis can provide the threshold facts to show defendant ingested a drug. Any other interpretation would allow a non-expert to speculate as to which drug was ingested by defendant. <i>Ortiz, supra.<\/i> The court further concluded that \"unlike the symptoms of intoxication, which are universally recognizable, the effects of any particular drug or class of drugs listed in <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-public-health\/article-33-controlled-substances\/title-1-general-provisions\/section-3306-schedules-of-controlled-substances\" class=\"raw-ref\">Public Health Law \u00a7 3306<\/a> are not necessarily uniform in the way they affect an individual's appearance.\" <i>Ortiz, supra.<\/i> That is, in the absence of drugs being found in the possession of the defendant, without some identification as to which drugs were allegedly ingested by the defendant, reasonable cause did not exist as to which offense(s) was\/were reasonably likely to have been committed and whether such offense(s) were committed by the defendant. Ultimately, in <i>Ortiz,<\/i> the court rejected the People's argument that the accusatory instrument was facially sufficient based on the officer's observations alone.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"29\" id=\"pa29\">The <i>Oritz<\/i> court's approach, however, has been rejected by courts in the Second and Third Departments. <i>People v.

In the course of the traffic stop, the defendant was found to be in possession of what the officer believed, based on his training and experience, to be nine bags of heroin together with a bag of marijuana and a marijuana pipe. At arraignment, the defendant plead guilty to Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Seventh Degree (PL \u00a7 220.03) and allocuted to possession of heroin. On appeal, the defendant argued that he was prosecuted by a criminal complaint and not an information in that the charges of possession were not made out by non-hearsay allegations, nor confirmed by a laboratory report that the substance which was recovered was in fact heroin, but, instead were only based upon the officer's personal observations and training and experience. The <i>Kalin<\/i> court specifically rejected this argument and held that non-hearsay allegations as to the identity of drugs are made out without any further independent corroboration when the drugs are found in the possession of the defendant and the accusatory instrument provides that the drugs are identified based on the officer's training and experience.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"34\" id=\"pa34\">Significantly in overruling previously embraced judicial approaches concerning the jurisdictional sufficiency of the accusatory instrument that had theretofore required independent corroboration, the court noted:<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"35\" id=\"pa35\"> <span page-number=\"220\" pagination-id=\"52 Misc. 3d 212\" id=\"p220\"><\/span> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"36\" id=\"pa36\">  <\/p><blockquote id=\"bq37\" bq-id=\"37\"> [The] core concerns were satisfied in this case. Defendant was on notice that: (1) he was charged with possessing heroin and marijuana discovered in the car in which he was a backseat passenger at approximately 10:50 PM on January 21, 2006 at the corner of Cypress and Myrtle Avenues in Queens; (2) the heroin was contained in nine separate plastic bags in the center console of the vehicle; and (3) the marijuana was found in a \"plastic zip lock bag\" inside the center console and a \"marijuana pipe containing a quantity of marijuana\" was found in the glove compartment. Based on these details, defendant could prepare a defense These facts were also specific enough to allow defendant to invoke the protection of double jeopardy in the event that he was acquitted of these charges but later subject to further prosecution. And, accepting the officer's statements as true, the assertions were enough to inform the defendant that the substances seized were heroin and marijuana Defendant claims that the officer's allegations present an inadequate foundation for identification of the drugs because the officer did not describe what the substances looked like, nor did he attach a laboratory report indicating that the substances have been tested and found to be heroin or marijuana. We have already rejected the notion that a laboratory report is necessary to set forth a prima facie case and we unanimously adhere to that holding today. And, as detailed previously, the officer in this case presented more in accusatory instrument than merely stating that he used his experience and training as the foundation in drawing the conclusion that he had discovered illegal drugs. He asserted that he also relied on packaging of the substance that he determined to be heroin and that the recovery of marijuana pipe further supported his belief that he had found marijuana.<br> <br>In our view, the pleading standards of the Criminal Procedure Law would be extended beyond what the Legislature <\/blockquote>   <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"38\" id=\"pa38\"> <span page-number=\"849\" pagination-id=\"27 N.Y.S.3d 841\" id=\"p849\"><\/span> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"39\" id=\"pa39\">  <\/p><blockquote id=\"bq40\" bq-id=\"40\"> intended if we were to require the recitation of mandatory catechism in an information that otherwise adequately identifies the particular drug, alleges that the accused possessed that illegal substance, states the officer's familiarity with and training regarding the identification of <\/blockquote>   <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"41\" id=\"pa41\"> <span page-number=\"221\" pagination-id=\"52 Misc. 3d 212\" id=\"p221\"><\/span> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"42\" id=\"pa42\">  <\/p><blockquote id=\"bq43\" bq-id=\"43\"> the drug, provides some information as to why the officer concluded that the substance was a particular type of illegal drug, and supplies sufficient *232 notice of the charged crime to satisfy the demands of due process and double jeopardy.

An information charging possession of cocaine, for example, could state that the substance was a \"white in color\" and \"powdery\", or \"off white\" and \"rock-like\" in appearance, whereas a charge of marijuana possession could be supported by a statement that the substance was \"green and leafy\". While it may be safer practice for law enforcement to routinely use descriptive phases, unlike our dissenting colleagues, we would not hold that the absence of such phraseology rendered the information in this case jurisdictionally deficient.<\/blockquote>   <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"44\" id=\"pa44\"> The accusatory instrument in the case before this court indicates that the defendant was obstructing traffic at an intersection while the traffic signal was green not allowing approximately four vehicles to drive around the defendant's vehicle and that the arresting officer observed the defendant exhibiting signs of impairment\u2014i.e., specifically, slurred speech, bloodshot red water eyes, unable to stand straight, sweating profusely, and having disheveled clothing. The accusatory instrument further provides that the arresting officer recovered cocaine from the driver's seat and from the defendant's pants' pocket, the arresting officer has training and experience in the identification of cocaine, the substance recovered in this case has the same physical characteristics chemically identified as cocaine in other cases, the officer based on his training and experience is familiar with common packaging of cocaine and that the plastic straw and Ziploc bag which were recovered in this case are common methods for packaging cocaine.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"45\" id=\"pa45\">Although <i>People v.

Therefore, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the People, the court finds that reasonable cause exists that would convince a person of ordinary intelligence, judgment and experience that the defendant operated a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by the use of cocaine.

The defendant moves pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law [\u201cCPL\u201d] \u00a7 240.20(1)(c) for discovery of the electronic raw data which yielded his DNA profile. The court initially denied the defendant's motion. Upon reargument and reconsideration, however, the court grants the motion.

Surveillance video captured the perpetrator knocking over the cash register touch screen with his hand during the incident. A New York Police Department [\u201cNYPD\u201d] officer swabbed the touch screen for biological evidence and submitted it to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner [\u201cOCME\u201d] Forensic Biology Department for DNA analysis. The OCME identified a mixture of DNA from at least three (3) people, including one (1) major male contributor. The OCME uploaded the 15 loci profile of the major male contributor to the New York State DNA Index System [\u201cSDIS\u201d], which resulted in a match to the defendant's \u201cConvicted Offender\u201d profile.<span page-number=\"905\" pagination-id=\"52 Misc. 3d 903\" id=\"p905\"><\/span> The defendant specifically demands the electronic raw data generated by the capillary electrophoresis instrument prior to processing or analysis. He contends that the OCME is able to extract this data from its .fsa files and compile it into an electronic document. Moreover, he asserts that because the OCME performed the DNA analysis at the NYPD's request, the People are bound to provide it.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\">The People oppose the defendant's motion, alleging that the electronic raw data \u201cis solely machine output,\u201d \u201cdoes not exist in any tangible readable form\u201d and has \u201cno discernable meaning.\u201d They assert that in order to retrieve the electronic raw data, the \u201cOCME would have to search its individual case files and extract the raw data from the individual separate batch files where it is stored in [their] computer system [and] mingled with raw data from countless other cases.\u201d Next, the OCME would have to \u201ccompile [the] data for all of the different stages of the DNA testing process in this case.\u201d Only then could the OCME provide the data \u201con some form of electronic media<a note-disclosure=\"1\" href=\"#N196646\"><\/a> .\u201d In any event, the People argue that because the OCME is an independent agency outside their control, they have no obligation to produce the electronic raw data. <\/p><div note-container=\"1\" id=\"N196646\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\"> The OCME confirms in a letter to the court that it is able to compile and transfer the raw electronic data stored in their .fsa files to a computer disc (<i>see<\/i> Exhibit C annexed to Defendant's Reply to People's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Reargue).<br> <br> <\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\">The electronic raw data is \u201ca series of overlapping, jagged, intermixed multicolored peaks that have no labels or other values\u201d (People's Response to Defendant's Omnibus Motion). Consequently, the OCME must process the electronic raw data through a software program<a note-disclosure=\"2\" href=\"#N196653\"><\/a> in order to interpret it. The software program produces an electropherogram which graphically depicts, along an x and y axis, distinct peaks of different colors with numerical labels indicating alleles and peak heights. To construct a DNA profile, an analyst reviews the electropherogram to decide whether to edit any additional <span page-number=\"906\" pagination-id=\"52 Misc. 3d 903\" id=\"p906\"><\/span> peaks as non-genetic material<a note-disclosure=\"3\" href=\"#N196664\"><\/a> . The analyst <span page-number=\"686\" pagination-id=\"33 N.Y.S.3d 683\" id=\"p686\"><\/span> documents his edits on a table which denotes the location of the peak and reason for the edit.  <\/p><div note-container=\"2\" id=\"N196653\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\"> The OCME utilizes the GeneMapper program which applies three (3) standard filters to the electronic raw data. The first filter is the \u201c75 relative fluorescent unit\u201d [\u201cRFU\u201d] threshold. This filter ensures that only peaks with a minimum height of 75 RFUs are labeled as alleles. The second is the \u201c10% global filter.\u201d This filter ensures that any peak which measures less than 10% of the highest peak at a particular locus is not labeled as an allele. The third filter is the stutter filter which ensures that any peak with a given percentage of RFUs at a predictable \u201cstutter\u201d position on the locus is not labeled as an allele. The stutter percentage varies depending on the locus.<br> <br> <\/p> <\/div><div note-container=\"3\" id=\"N196664\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\"> Non-genetic material, such as an artifact from the amplification process, noise from the capillary electrophoresis instrument, or a phenomenon known as stutter, may produce a peak on the electropherogram. When an analyst edits a peak, he removes its label as an allele.<br> <br> <\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"15\" id=\"pa15\">The People maintain that they have complied with their discovery obligation by giving the defendant a copy of the entire OCME Forensic Biology Department file, including the electropherogram and edit table. The defendant counters that without the electronic raw data, he cannot adequately evaluate the DNA evidence. He states that the filters which the OCME sets for the software program affect how the peaks appear on the electropherogram<a note-disclosure=\"4\" href=\"#N196677\"><\/a> . Thus he contends that he cannot ascertain from the copy of the electropherogram the precise height, shape and location of unlabeled peaks which fall below the OCME filter threshold. Accordingly, the defendant avers that he intends to process the raw data through two (2) different software programs<a note-disclosure=\"5\" href=\"#N196682\"><\/a> and that he may retain an expert.  <\/p><div note-container=\"4\" id=\"N196677\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"16\" id=\"pa16\"> The defendant cites to John Butler, author of <i>Fundamentals of Forensic DNA Typing<\/i> (1st ed. 2009), as an expert who utilizes a peak detection threshold of 50, rather than 75, RFUs. In any event, the defendant argues that he requires the raw data to determine whether the OCME properly applied the standard filters.<br> <br> <\/p> <\/div><div note-container=\"5\" id=\"N196682\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"17\" id=\"pa17\"> These software programs are: OSIRIS, a public domain program offered by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and GeneMarker, a program manufactured by SoftGenetics, LLC.<br> <br> <\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"18\" id=\"pa18\"> A defendant's right to discovery in a criminal case is statutory rather than constitutional (<i>see Matter of <\/i> <i>Brown v.

By enacting the discovery statute, the legislature expressed its intent that a criminal trial \u201cshould not be a sporting event where each side remains ignorant of the facts in the hands of the adversary until events unfold at trial\u201d (<i>People v.

Neither a computer source code nor the electronic raw data exists in a form which is readable without interpretation. Nevertheless, like the source code for the Intoxilyzer 5000EN, the electronic raw data embodies or conveys information concerning a scientific test. As such, the electronic raw data is as much a \u201c written document\u201d as the source code (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-240-discovery\/section-24020-repealed-discovery-upon-demand-of-defendant\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 240.20<\/a>[1][c] ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"24\" id=\"pa24\"> The defendant argues, and the People do not dispute, that determining \u201cwhether a certain peak represents an allele from one (1) person, alleles from more than one (1) person, or non-genetic information ... requires human judgment where two (2) criminalists can reach different conclusions.\u201d As the New York Court of Appeals has aptly observed, \u201cwe will not indulge in the science fiction that DNA evidence is merely machine generated.... The sophisticated software programs require trained analysts who engage in skilled interpretation of the data from the electrophoresis instrument, using the computer <span page-number=\"688\" pagination-id=\"33 N.Y.S.3d 683\" id=\"p688\"><\/span> software with its color images, particularly as to the peaks in the graphs, to construct the DNA profile\u201d (<i>People v. John,<\/i> 27 N.Y.3d 294, 311, 33 N.Y.S.3d 88, 52 N.E.3d 1114 [2016] ). Consequently, defense counsel and his experts should have the opportunity to evaluate this highly-technical evidence which is \u201copen to interpretation given the rapid pace of advances in the development of this field\u201d (<i>DaGata,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-dagata-1#p44\" class=\"raw-ref\">86 N.Y.2d at 44\u201345<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-dagata-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">629 N.Y.S.2d 186<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-dagata-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">652 N.E.2d 932<\/a> ). Truly, \u201cthe best judge of the value of evidence to a defendant's case is the single-minded devotion of counsel for the accused\u201d (<i>id.<\/i> [internal citations omitted] ). Because the electronic raw data is subject to interpretation by both the software program which processes it and the analyst who <span page-number=\"909\" pagination-id=\"52 Misc. 3d 903\" id=\"p909\"><\/span> constructs the DNA profile, the defendant cannot effectively challenge the DNA evidence without it.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"25\" id=\"pa25\">Furthermore, because the OCME performed the DNA analysis at the NYPD's request, the People must disclose the electronic raw data (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-240-discovery\/section-24020-repealed-discovery-upon-demand-of-defendant\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 240.20<\/a> [1 ][c] ). The OCME is required by law to perform an autopsy under circumstances where homicide is suspected (<i>see <\/i> <i>People v. Washington,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-washington-357#p192\" class=\"raw-ref\">86 N.Y.2d 189, 192\u2013193<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-washington-357\" class=\"raw-ref\">630 N.Y.S.2d 693<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-washington-357\" class=\"raw-ref\">654 N.E.2d 967<\/a> [1995] ). In fulfilling its statutory duty, the OCME functions as an independent agency outside the People's control (<i>see id.<\/i> ). Accordingly, the People are not obligated to provide a defendant with autopsy notes which they do not possess (<i>see id.<\/i> ). In contrast, here the OCME was not mandated to perform the DNA analysis. It did so solely at the behest of the NYPD, which collected the biological evidence and submitted it for that purpose. The electronic raw data therefore is discoverable under the rule which permits the defendant to view the prosecution's scientific evidence (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-240-discovery\/section-24020-repealed-discovery-upon-demand-of-defendant\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 240.20<\/a>[1][c] ; <i>see also <\/i> <i>DaGata,<\/i> 86 N.Y.2d at 45, 629 N.Y.S.2d 186, 652 N.E.2d 932 ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"26\" id=\"pa26\">That the OCME must extract the raw electronic data from their computer storage files and compile it onto a computer disc in order to provide it in tangible form does not excuse the People's obligation to produce it.

Defendant agreed, followed the officers, and spoke to them. He was not frisked, searched, handcuffed or told that he was under arrest. They then asked if he would come with them to the precinct to assist in their investigation. Defendant expressly agreed, once the officers promised to pay his cover charge on re-entry to Roseland. Defendant was not placed in a squad car; rather, he walked freely along public streets with plainclothes detectives until, shortly after the murder and robbery, he reached the crime scene where he was identified by the victim's father, and his distinctive shirt and large wooden beads were recognized by the victim's mother, brother and sister-in-law. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"4\" id=\"pa4\"> The trial court properly determined that defendant was not arrested at Roseland since a reasonable person innocent of any crime would not have considered himself or herself under arrest under the same circumstances ( <i>People v. Yukl<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-yukl#p589\" class=\"raw-ref\">25 N.Y.2d 585, 589<\/a>, <i>cert denied<\/i> 400 U.S. 851). The showup was, likewise, properly upheld. It is well established that while there is a degree of suggestiveness inherent in every showup, showups are permissible if, like here, they are not unduly suggestive and occur near the scene of the crime and shortly after it ( <i>People v. Duuvon<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-duuvon-1#p544\" class=\"raw-ref\">77 N.Y.2d 541, 544<\/a>; <i>People v.

To the degree defense counsel wished to argue that suggestiveness led these witnesses to identify defendant's shirt, this argument went to the weight of the evidence and was one to be made to the jury, not to the court in a suppression hearing. Because defendant alleged only \"differences\" in the corporeal identification by the victim's father and the recognition of defendant's clothing by other family members, he failed to provide \"some indication that the pretrial identification procedure was suggestive\" and was thus not entitled to call the other family members at the independent source hearing regarding the father's identification ( <i>People v. Chipp<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-chipp-4#p338\" class=\"raw-ref\">75 N.Y.2d 327, 338<\/a>, <i>cert denied<\/i> 498 U.S. 833). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"6\" id=\"pa6\"> The court properly exercised its discretion ( <i>People v.

Such evidence is not beyond the ken of the ordinary juror. Through cross-examination and proper jury instructions deficiencies in eyewitness identification testimony are highlighted to jurors, the ultimate finders of the facts ( <i>People v.

The contract provided that \"due to fire damage to the premises Purchaser will be required to perform repairs and renovations to the premises,\" but no work would be commenced before the closing of title without the written consent of the seller. The contract further provided that the seller was not required to spend any money to cure violations. The contract stated that any losses incurred by destruction, damage or condemnation while the contract was pending were governed by <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-general-obligations\/article-5-creation-definition-and-enforcement-of-contractual-obligations\/title-13-construction-of-particular-terms-in-contractual-transactions\/section-5-1311-uniform-vendor-and-purchaser-risk-act\" class=\"raw-ref\">General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-1311<\/a>. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"7\" id=\"pa7\"> The purchaser's attorney acknowledged at the trial that on February 6, 2003 he received notice from the seller that there was a hearing in the Supreme Court, Queens County, with respect to unsafe building violations on the premises. The purchaser was represented at the hearing on the violations but the Supreme Court found that the purchaser had no standing to appear in the matter or to request any relief. On February 19, 2003 the Supreme Court issued an order directing the Superintendent of Buildings to make the premises safe by demolishing \"unused spaces to grade and remov[ing] all debris from site.\" <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"8\" id=\"pa8\"> At the trial, the seller's president testified that he asked the purchaser to perform repairs to avert demolition, but the purchaser refused to perform any work until title was transferred to him. The seller's president further testified that the Department of Buildings would not accept applications for permits filed by the purchaser because there were discrepancies in the purchaser's contractor's license or insurance policy. Therefore the seller entered into a contract with Rankin Construction to repair the premises for the sum of $120,000. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"9\" id=\"pa9\"> The seller refused to deliver title to the purchaser until it was <span page-number=\"767\" pagination-id=\"34 A.D.3d 765\" id=\"p767\"><\/span> reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. The purchaser refused to reimburse the seller on the ground that the contract did not provide for reimbursement for repairs and commenced the instant action for specific performance at the \"purchase price of $588,000.\" At the conclusion of the trial, the Supreme Court determined that the purchaser was ready willing and able to close but nevertheless denied specific performance and directed the seller to return the down payment plus interest. We affirm. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\"> Although an appellate court's authority in reviewing a nonjury determination is as broad as that of the trial court, due deference is given to the trial court's determination, taking into account that in a close case the trial judge has the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses ( <i>see Healy v Williams<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/healy-v-williams#p468\" class=\"raw-ref\">30 AD3d 466, 468<\/a>). The determination of whether to grant or deny the equitable remedy of specific performance lies within the discretion of the court and the right to such relief is not automatic ( <i>see Sokoloff v Harriman Estates Dev. Corp.<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/sokoloff-v-harriman-estates-dev-corp#p415\" class=\"raw-ref\">96 NY2d 409, 415<\/a>; <i>McGinnis v Cowhey<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/mcginnis-v-cowhey\" class=\"raw-ref\">24 AD3d 629<\/a>). Indeed, a court may deny specific performance where the grant of such remedy would result in \"unreasonable hardship or injustice\" ( <i>id.<\/i> at 629). Here, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in determining that an award of specific performance would have resulted in undue hardship or injustice to the seller. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\"> The purchaser contends that the order dated February 19, 2003 directing demolition was analogous to a destruction or taking by eminent domain to which <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-general-obligations\/article-5-creation-definition-and-enforcement-of-contractual-obligations\/title-13-construction-of-particular-terms-in-contractual-transactions\/section-5-1311-uniform-vendor-and-purchaser-risk-act\" class=\"raw-ref\">General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-1311<\/a> applied. The term \"destruction\" refers to accidental destruction after the contract is executed but before title has passed ( <i>see Lucenti v Cayuga Apts.<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/lucenti-v-cayuga-apts#p537\" class=\"raw-ref\">48 NY2d 530, 537<\/a>).

The Appellate Division held that the issue had been preserved for appellate review and that such cross-examination was \"unfair and improper\" and \"impinged upon defendant's right to a fair trial\", mandating a new trial ( <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-maschi-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">65 A.D.2d 405<\/a>). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"9\" id=\"pa9\"> Our examination of the record discloses that defendant did <span page-number=\"786\" pagination-id=\"49 N.Y.2d 784\" id=\"p786\"><\/span> not register a timely or effective protest to the challenged cross-examination and therefore failed to preserve the error, if any, for appellate review. After the prosecutor, without objection, had asked some 19 questions relevant to the failure of the witness to come forward, when he asked the twentieth, capping question defense counsel interposed an unembellished \"objection\" which was overruled. We conclude there was no timely objection to this line of cross-examination and note that when objection was finally made defense counsel did not advance the theory of error which he now asserts (22 N.Y.CRR 604.1 [d] [4]). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\"> In this procedural posture, the case must be remitted to the Appellate Division for that court to determine whether to exercise its discretionary power to review defendant's claim of reversible error in the absence of adequate protest and, if it so determines, then to rule thereon <i>(People v Cona,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-cona-1#p33\" class=\"raw-ref\">49 N.Y.2d 26, 33-34<\/a>).

Lawrence<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-lawrence-149\" class=\"raw-ref\">64 N.Y.2d 200<\/a>). Nevertheless, we find that the defendant's motion was properly denied on the ground that it was not made upon reasonable notice to the People, as required by <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-i-preliminary-proceedings-in-superior-court\/article-210-proceedings-in-superior-court-from-filing-of-indictment-to-plea\/section-21045-motion-to-dismiss-indictment-procedure\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 210.45 (1)<\/a>. The trial of this matter was scheduled to commence on February 21, 1989, but was adjourned to February 23, 1989. Neither the prosecutor nor the court was advised of the defendant's intent to make a speedy trial motion until after the People moved the case to trial on February 23, 1989, and a panel of prospective jurors was waiting outside the courtroom door. At that point, the codefendant's counsel handed the motion papers to the court and served them upon the prosecutor. The motion was made returnable on February 21, 1989, prior to the date the papers were served upon the People. Under the circumstances, we agree with the trial court that the defense counsel's tactics deprived the People of reasonable notice of the motion <i>(see, People v. Lawrence, supra).<\/i> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"5\" id=\"pa5\"> In any event, even if the defendant's motion had been timely made, the sworn allegations in support of the motion did not establish that he was entitled to dismissal of the indictment <i>(see<\/i>, <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-i-preliminary-proceedings-in-superior-court\/article-210-proceedings-in-superior-court-from-filing-of-indictment-to-plea\/section-21045-motion-to-dismiss-indictment-procedure\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 210.45<\/a>). A mistrial had been declared on January 23, 1989. Pursuant to CPL 30.30 (5) (a), the six-month period in which the People were required to announce their readiness for trial commenced on the date the order occasioning the retrial became final <i>(see, People v. Holmes<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-holmes-68\" class=\"raw-ref\">105 A.D.2d 803<\/a>; <i>People v Passero<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-passero-12\" class=\"raw-ref\">96 A.D.2d 721<\/a>; <i>People v. Fudger<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-fudger-1\" class=\"raw-ref\">70 A.D.2d 703<\/a>). As the defendant's retrial commenced about one month after the mistrial was declared, his claim that he was denied his right to a speedy trial is without merit. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"6\" id=\"pa6\"> The defendant further contends that the court erred in closing the courtroom to the public during the testimony of the undercover police officer who was involved in his arrest. At a hearing on the People's application for closure, the officer testified that he was still working in an undercover capacity and that investigations pending in the same geographical area where the defendant was arrested would be jeopardized if his identity as a police officer were revealed.

After due consideration of the papers, the petition is denied for the reasons stated below. <\/p> <h3> <u>BACKGROUND<\/u> <\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\"> On May 30, 1992, Harry Surujlall and his brother Gopaul Surujlall (\"Harry\" and <span page-number=\"2\" pagination-id=\"00 CV 1198\" id=\"p2\"><\/span> \"Gopaul,\" respectively) were shot outside the Benob Social Club on Jamaica Avenue in Queens, New York. Prior to the shooting, Harry had argued inside the social club with a person who was with Goberdhan. The argument continued outside the club, but Harry and Gopaul walked away from it. Goberdhan first shot Harry in the neck. He then shot Gopaul in the buttocks as he tried to run away. While Gopaul was lying on the ground, Goberdhan approached him, aimed at his head, and shot. He hit Gopaul in the arm because Gopaul moved his head. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\"> After interviewing the victims, the police put together a photograph array that included a photograph of Goberdhan, Both Harry and Gopaul identified Goberdhan as the shooter. On August 21, 1992, after Goberdhan was arrested, he was identified by the two victims in a line-up at a police precinct. In post-arrest statements, Goberdhan admitted that he was present in front of the Benob Social Club on the night in question when shots were fired, but he denied any participation in the shooting. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\"> Goberdhan was charged with two counts of attempted murder in the second degree, two counts of assault in the first degree, one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\"> Before trial, Goberdhan moved to suppress both his post-arrest statements and the line-up identifications by Harry and Gopaul. At the hearings, photographs of the line-up were entered into evidence, photocopies of which were given to the defense. The motion was denied after a <u>Huntley\/Wade<\/u> <a note-disclosure=\"1\" href=\"#cae4cef8-2f59-4159-97fd-22df846204a7-fn1\"><\/a> hearing was held in Supreme Court, Queens County. <span page-number=\"3\" pagination-id=\"00 CV 1198\" id=\"p3\"><\/span>  <\/p><div note-container=\"1\" id=\"cae4cef8-2f59-4159-97fd-22df846204a7-fn1\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\"> At a <u>Huntley<\/u> hearing the judge determines the admissibility of a confession before it is heard by a jury. <u>People v.

The trial court denied the motion. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"16\" id=\"pa16\"> At trial in Supreme Court, Queens County, Goberdhan again objected to testimony about Gopaul's line-up identification, saying he had not received the photographs of the event. The prosecutor explained that the original photographs, which had been received in evidence at the<u>Huntley\/Wade<\/u> hearing, were missing, though it was not the prosecution's fault. In any event, the prosecutor argued, copies had been given to the defendant at the <u>Huntley\/Wade<\/u> hearing. The court allowed the testimony. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"17\" id=\"pa17\"> Towards the end of the trial, Goberdhan requested that the court give a missing witness charge regarding Karen Mandell. Mandell was a friend of the two victims and had driven them to the Benob Social Club and to the hospital after the shootings. Goberdhan alleged that Mandell had told police she thought she would be able to identify the shooter and, consequently, should have been called as a witness by the prosecution. The prosecutor told the court that when he asked Mandell about her statement to the police, she said that, in fact, she had not seen the shooting take place. The court did not give a missing witness instruction. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"18\" id=\"pa18\"> On July 15, 1994, the jury found Goberdhan guilty of the two counts of attempted murder in the second degree, one count of assault in the first degree and both weapons possession charges. Goberdhan was sentenced to from twelve and one-half to twenty-five years for the attempted murder convictions, seven and one-half to fifteen years for the assault conviction and one year each for the possession counts, All sentences were imposed concurrently. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"19\" id=\"pa19\"> Goberdhan appealed to the Appellate Division, Second Department, raising the <span page-number=\"4\" pagination-id=\"00 CV 1198\" id=\"p4\"><\/span> missing witness charge and the speedy trial issue, and claiming that the court should have suppressed the evidence of the line-up identification by Gopaul On April 6, 1998, the Appellate Division affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County holding that the court correctly decided not to give a missing witness charge.<u>People v.

He further contends that his arrest was not based on probable cause. The stipulated record, however, does not contain motion papers establishing that defendant sought suppression on those grounds and thus, defendant has not preserved those issues for our review ( <i>see<\/i>, <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-m-proceedings-after-judgment\/article-470-appeals-determination-thereof\/section-47005-determination-of-appeals-general-criteria\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 470.05<\/a>). Additionally, the record contains no final determination of County Court on a suppression motion, and therefore, defendant, by pleading guilty before the court rendered its final determination, forfeited review of those issues ( <i>see, People v.

Moreover, even assuming, arguendo, that a suppression motion had been denied, defendant neither alleged nor established that he had standing to challenge the search of the vehicle and, therefore, no standing issue is preserved for our review ( <i>see, People v Carter<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-carter-613#p722\" class=\"raw-ref\">86 N.Y.2d 721, 722-723<\/a>, <i>rearg denied<\/i> 86 N.Y.2d 839; <i>People v.

Facts of the Instant Case<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"23\" id=\"pa23\">According to the sworn information in this case, an officer responded to an accident between defendant's motorcycle and another vehicle on July 29, 2019 at 2:05 a.m. on Hamilton and Third Avenue in Kings County (<i>see<\/i> Superseding Information dated Jan. 10, 2020, at 1). The defendant was taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries sustained in the accident. The police officer alleges that the defendant displayed signs of intoxication, namely slurred speech and an odor of alcohol on his breath, and that he admitted to having two beers (<i>id.<\/i> at 1). The defendant was asked to submit to a breathalyzer test but refused to do so (<i>id.<\/i> ). The police officer also alleges that he ascertained that the defendant's license to drive had previously been revoked for a prior conviction for criminally negligent homicide and that he observed an 18-inch long knife on defendant's belt (<i>id.<\/i> at 2).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"24\" id=\"pa24\">The defendant was arraigned on August 2, 2019, while the defendant was still in the hospital, and the case was adjourned to September 11, 2019 for the People to obtain the supporting deposition of the other driver in the accident who observed the defendant operating the motorcycle. As the People did not have that supporting deposition on the next date, the case was adjourned again for conversion to November 15, 2019. The People filed the supporting deposition and a statement of readiness off-calendar on October 21st. On November 15, 2019, the complaint was deemed an information and the matter was adjourned for discovery by stipulation until December 5, 2019.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"25\" id=\"pa25\"> On December 5th, the People provided discovery to the defense counsel, including the footage from the officer's body-worn camera, the 911 call, Sprint report and radio runs, and the police paperwork. The case was then adjourned for the first time for hearings and trial to January 10, 2020.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"26\" id=\"pa26\">On December 6th, the People applied for and obtained a search warrant to seize a sample of the defendant's blood taken while he was being treated at the hospital for injuries sustained during the accident and submit it for testing. On January 2nd, 2020, the People received a one-page report from the forensic laboratory of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (\"OCME\") showing results of .21% ethanol for defendant's blood sample.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"27\" id=\"pa27\">On January 10th, 2020, the first scheduled trial date, the People announced ready for trial and filed a certificate of compliance (\"COC\"), which included an inventory of discovery previously provided on December 5th, 2019, as well as additional discovery shared electronically on January 7th and 8th, including the search warrant materials and the request for a laboratory examination report. On this date, the People also served defense counsel with the one-page OCME laboratory report and acknowledged that additional OCME material regarding the blood draw existed and had been requested from the OCME but was not yet in the People's possession. The defendant challenged the validity of the COC arguing that under <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24520-automatic-discovery\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.20(1) (j)<\/a> the People were required to provide the underlying OCME toxicology case file and that the outstanding discovery rendered the COC invalid.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"28\" id=\"pa28\">In a colloquy with the Court, the People stated that they were prepared to proceed with the trial as a refusal case, without using the blood draw as evidence in their case. Further, the People detailed their efforts to obtain the outstanding data from OCME, including a request for expedited production as well as daily follow up on the progress of their request for the file.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"29\" id=\"pa29\">In a preliminary oral ruling, this Court agreed that the underlying OCME casefile fell within the statutory discovery provision for \"reports, documents, records, data, calculations or writings... concerning scientific tests relating to the criminal action or proceeding which were made by or at the request or direction of a public servant engaged in law enforcement activity\" (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24520-automatic-discovery\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.20 (1) (j)<\/a> ).

Therefore, any preliminary findings of January 10th, are superseded by the rulings contained herein.<\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"31\" id=\"pa31\">On February 4, 2020, the defense filed the instant motion to dismiss the charges pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a> claiming 115 chargeable days.

While the new standards are equally applicable to all cases that have been pending since 2019 or before, the effect of the application of these new standards upon the chargeability or excludability of adjournments from 2019 into 2020 will depend upon the particular circumstances and posture of the individual case.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"34\" id=\"pa34\">Here, both parties agree that as of the December 5th date, 80 days of speedy trial time were chargeable to the People. There are two court adjournments critical to the disposition of the defendant's motion: from December 5, 2019 to January 10, 2020 and from January 10, 2020 to February 5, 2020.<\/p> <h3>a) Adjournment from December 5, 2019 to January 10, 2020 for hearing and trial<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"36\" id=\"pa36\">The People filed discovery on December 5th under the prior agreement in Kings County between the District Attorney's office and the defense bar known as \"discovery by stipulation\" (\"DBS\") which involved a version of open file discovery and waiver of formal motion practice. Adjournments for DBS were \"the functional equivalent of pre-trial discovery and motion practice\" and were excluded from speedy trial calculations pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a> [4][a] (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v.

Khachiyan<\/i> , 194 Misc 2d 161 [Crim Ct, Kings County 2002] ). Furthermore, speedy trial precedent has long established that the People are entitled to a reasonable time to prepare for trial after an adjournment for motion practice ( <i>People v. Greene,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-greene-71\" class=\"raw-ref\">223 AD2d 474<\/a> [1st Dept 1996] ). Thus, prior to the enactment of the new criminal procedure laws, the People were routinely granted a period of excludable time to prepare for trial after rulings on an omnibus motion and demand to produce; here in Kings County, the same exclusion applied after the provision of DBS to prepare for trial and any hearings to be held on the consent of the People (<i>see<\/i> <i>Dorilas<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-dorilas\" class=\"raw-ref\">19 Misc 3d 75<\/a> ; <i>People v.

Notably, courts still applied this exclusion of time even when the People were not actually ready to prepare for trial (<i>Dorilas<\/i> , at 799)(reasonable period of delay resulting from DBS excluded \"despite the fact that the People had not yet converted the misdemeanor complaint\").<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"37\" id=\"pa37\">Under this established precedent, the adjournment from December 5th to January 10th, 2020 was not chargeable, as it falls squarely within the <i>Green<\/i> exclusion for trial preparation after DBS was provided by the People, and before the first scheduled date for hearing and trial.

The People were not expected to be ready to start a trial until January 10th, and on that date, they filed a certificate of compliance and stated ready to proceed. The new discovery requirements and standards did not exist until after DBS was provided and after an adjournment was granted for hearing and trial. Because the case was in trial preparation posture immediately after DBS and the People exercised due diligence in meeting their discovery obligations under the 2020 standards on the first trial date, the Court finds the time period between December 5th and January 10th is properly excluded from the speedy trial clock under Section 4 [a] of <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a> and <i>Green<\/i> .<\/p> <h3>b) Adjournment from January 10, 2020 to February 5, 2020 for hearing and trial<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"44\" id=\"pa44\">The defendant also argues that the COC filed on January 10th was invalid, as the People did not provide the underlying OCME case file regarding the toxicology report, and therefore, the People's statement of readiness is inaccurate and should not serve to stop the speedy trial clock.

The record shows that the underlying case file for the toxicology report on the defendant's blood is material evidence currently unavailable to the People. The record also shows that the People have demonstrated due diligence in obtaining the toxicology report from OCME and in their attempts to acquire the underlying case file. The People submitted a request to expedite production of the file, then conducted a daily inquiry into the status of that request and expect the file to be provided shortly. The record also reflects that prior to filing the COC, the People had completed their remaining discovery obligations.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"49\" id=\"pa49\">Moreover, the Court is satisfied on this record that the People were actually ready to proceed to trial on January 10th without relying upon the outstanding discovery material.

The prosecutorial decision of whether to seek out additional evidence involves many discretionary factors, including the real risk that the blood toxicology report may not have resulted in incriminating evidence against the defendant. Where, as here, the People can point to other evidence to meet their burden of proof, a later decision to pursue a search warrant in an attempt to strengthen their case, cannot be equated with a lack of diligence.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"52\" id=\"pa52\">Therefore, under these facts, the Court is satisfied that the People filed their COC on January 10th, 2020 in good faith, that diligent efforts to obtain the outstanding material were made and that the People were actually ready for trial when they so stated.

Anderson<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-anderson-675#p534\" class=\"raw-ref\">66 NY2d 529, 534-535<\/a> [1985] ). When a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated, the remedy is dismissal (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v.

In determining whether a constitutional speedy trial violation has occurred, the Court must weigh five factors: (1) the extent of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the nature of the underlying charge; (4) the extent of pretrial incarceration; and (5) whether the defense was impaired by the delay (<i>see<\/i> <i>Taranovich<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-taranovich#p445\" class=\"raw-ref\">37 NY2d at 445<\/a> ). The Court evaluates these factors on an <i>ad hoc<\/i> basis, \"since no rigid precepts may be formulated which apply to each and every instance\" of an alleged constitutional right to speedy trial violation (<i>id.<\/i> ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"56\" id=\"pa56\">In this case, six months have elapsed from the time the defendant was arraigned until he filed the instant motion. The parties agree that at least 80 days of that time are chargeable to the People. The Court finds that under the facts of this case, any delays caused by the People's lack of readiness were not due to a lack of diligence by the People and were minimal. Indeed, the People answered ready multiple times over the pendency of the case. Specifically, the People filed an off-calendar statement of readiness upon conversion of the complaint within three months of the defendant's arraignment and then again answered ready on the first scheduled trial date on January 10, 2020.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"57\" id=\"pa57\">Neither the extent nor the reasons for the delay warrant dismissal. More egregious examples of delay in advancing towards trial have not warranted findings that the constitutional right to speedy trial has been violated (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v. Thompson<\/i> , 43 Misc 3d 136(A) [App Term 1st Dept 2014] (21-month delay, mostly resulting from court congestion and defendant's motion practice or unavailability, and where limited delay attributable to the People was not deliberate attempt to hamper defendant's preparation of his defense, did not justify dismissal of traffic infraction on speedy trial grounds); <i>People v.

Tejada<\/i> , 48 Misc 3d 1226(A) [Crim Ct Bronx County 2015] (one year delay, where only three court dates were scheduled for hearing and trial, did not warrant dismissal of traffic infraction).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"58\" id=\"pa58\"> Furthermore, defendant was not incarcerated on this offense, so the extent of pretrial incarceration is not a consideration here. Nor is impairment of defense a significant factor here. Although the police officer witness's ability to recollect details about his interaction with the defendant is likely lessened by the passage of time, there is also a greater likelihood that the defendant may create reasonable doubt as to the officer's testimony for this same reason.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"59\" id=\"pa59\">Having evaluated the particular facts and circumstances of this case under the <i>Tarantovich<\/i> factors, the Court finds that the defendant's constitutional speedy trial rights have not been violated. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on constitutional speedy trial grounds is DENIED.<\/p> <h3>III. MOTION TO CONTROVERT THE SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE SEIZED UPON ITS EXECUTION<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"61\" id=\"pa61\">Defendant argues that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause because the affidavit in support of the search warrant, sworn to by Police Officer Yukshing Chai, relies on the hearsay statements of the complainant, Margarita Quirindogo (<i>see<\/i> Def.'s Affirmation at pp. 4, 7-8). Defendant further argues that the People's failure to provide notice of the application for a search warrant is a violation of the defendant's due process rights requiring suppression of the obtained evidence (<i>id.<\/i> at 8-9).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"62\" id=\"pa62\">\"A presumption of validity attaches to a warrant, which has already been tested by the issuing Judge, thus simplifying the suppression court's task to determining whether the issuing Judge could reasonably have concluded that probable cause existed\" ( <i>People v.

The officer's affidavit describes information relayed directly from the complainant that the defendant \"disobeyed the pavement markings and went straight ahead colliding with the witness\" (Def.'s Brief, exhibit B, p.3). Further, the officer observed the defendant with head injuries at the scene and again later at Methodist Hospital, where the defendant was treated for injuries from the collision. At the hospital when Officer Chai attempted to interview the defendant, he observed the defendant to have slurred speech and alcohol on his breath and heard the defendant admit to hospital staff that he had 2 beers earlier that evening (<i>id.<\/i> at 5). The information contained in the 911 call combined with the officer's observations of the defendant's injury, his intoxicated condition and the defendant's admission of drinking earlier that night were sufficient to establish the reliability of the informant and provided ample basis for the issuance of probable cause that the defendant was driving while intoxicated by alcohol.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"64\" id=\"pa64\"> The defendant further argues that the People's failure to provide notice of the search warrant application violated his right to due process and requires suppression of the blood sample pursuant to the Court of Appeals holding in <i>Matter of Abe A<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">56 NY2d 288<\/a> [1982]. The Court disagrees. As a general rule, an <i>ex parte<\/i> application for a search warrant is lawful, \"since the target of a search warrant has no right to notice or an opportunity to be heard on the application\" ( <i>People v. McNair<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-mcnair-8\" class=\"raw-ref\">85 AD3d 693<\/a> [1st Dept 2011]. <i>Abe A<\/i> and its progeny establish special rules for evidence taken from a suspect's body, such as blood or DNA samples ( <i>People v.

England<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-england-26#p4\" class=\"raw-ref\">84 NY2d 1, 4<\/a> [1994] ). Readiness for trial encompasses two elements. First, the People must \"answer ready\" by either communicating their readiness in open court or by filing a certificate of actual readiness with the court and serving a copy on the defendant's attorney (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v.

The defendant was asked to submit to a breathalyzer test but refused to do so (<i>id.<\/i> ). The police officer also alleges that he ascertained that the defendant's license to drive had previously been revoked for a prior conviction for criminally negligent homicide and that he observed an 18-inch long knife on defendant's belt (<i>id.<\/i> at 2).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"24\" id=\"pa24\">The defendant was arraigned on August 2, 2019, while the defendant was still in the hospital, and the case was adjourned to September 11, 2019 for the People to obtain the supporting deposition of the other driver in the accident who observed the defendant operating the motorcycle. As the People did not have that supporting deposition on the next date, the case was adjourned again for conversion to November 15, 2019.

On November 15, 2019, the complaint was deemed an information and the matter was adjourned for discovery by stipulation until December 5, 2019.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"25\" id=\"pa25\"> On December 5th, the People provided discovery to the defense counsel, including the footage from the officer's body-worn camera, the 911 call, Sprint report and radio runs, and the police paperwork. The case was then adjourned for the first time for hearings and trial to January 10, 2020.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"26\" id=\"pa26\">On December 6th, the People applied for and obtained a search warrant to seize a sample of the defendant's blood taken while he was being treated at the hospital for injuries sustained during the accident and submit it for testing. On January 2nd, 2020, the People received a one-page report from the forensic laboratory of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (\"OCME\") showing results of .21% ethanol for defendant's blood sample.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"27\" id=\"pa27\">On January 10th, 2020, the first scheduled trial date, the People announced ready for trial and filed a certificate of compliance (\"COC\"), which included an inventory of discovery previously provided on December 5th, 2019, as well as additional discovery shared electronically on January 7th and 8th, including the search warrant materials and the request for a laboratory examination report. On this date, the People also served defense counsel with the one-page OCME laboratory report and acknowledged that additional OCME material regarding the blood draw existed and had been requested from the OCME but was not yet in the People's possession. The defendant challenged the validity of the COC arguing that under <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24520-automatic-discovery\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.20(1) (j)<\/a> the People were required to provide the underlying OCME toxicology case file and that the outstanding discovery rendered the COC invalid.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"28\" id=\"pa28\">In a colloquy with the Court, the People stated that they were prepared to proceed with the trial as a refusal case, without using the blood draw as evidence in their case. Further, the People detailed their efforts to obtain the outstanding data from OCME, including a request for expedited production as well as daily follow up on the progress of their request for the file.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"29\" id=\"pa29\">In a preliminary oral ruling, this Court agreed that the underlying OCME casefile fell within the statutory discovery provision for \"reports, documents, records, data, calculations or writings... concerning scientific tests relating to the criminal action or proceeding which were made by or at the request or direction of a public servant engaged in law enforcement activity\" (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24520-automatic-discovery\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.20 (1) (j)<\/a> ). The Court directed the People to file a supplemental COC and stated the Court \"did not believe [the People] made a valid statement of readiness today.\" (tr. of Jan. 10, 2020, at 10-11).<a note-disclosure=\"3\" href=\"#N30091\"><\/a> The Court further noted the trial part was not available for hearings and trial that day, and therefore, the matter could not proceed that day (<i>id.<\/i> at 9).

Conclusions of Law<\/b> <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"33\" id=\"pa33\">The statutory amendments concerning the speedy trial and discovery law apply to all pending proceedings as of the January 1, 2020 effective date (<i>see<\/i> US Const Amend V, XIV: NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6, 11 ; <i>see also McKinney's Consolidated Laws of NY \u00a7 55 ;<\/i> <i>Wade v.

Lobato,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-lobato-15\" class=\"raw-ref\">2020 NY Slip Op 50322<\/a> [U] [Crim Ct, Kings County 2020] ). While the new standards are equally applicable to all cases that have been pending since 2019 or before, the effect of the application of these new standards upon the chargeability or excludability of adjournments from 2019 into 2020 will depend upon the particular circumstances and posture of the individual case.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"34\" id=\"pa34\">Here, both parties agree that as of the December 5th date, 80 days of speedy trial time were chargeable to the People. There are two court adjournments critical to the disposition of the defendant's motion: from December 5, 2019 to January 10, 2020 and from January 10, 2020 to February 5, 2020.<\/p> <h3>a) Adjournment from December 5, 2019 to January 10, 2020 for hearing and trial<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"36\" id=\"pa36\">The People filed discovery on December 5th under the prior agreement in Kings County between the District Attorney's office and the defense bar known as \"discovery by stipulation\" (\"DBS\") which involved a version of open file discovery and waiver of formal motion practice. Adjournments for DBS were \"the functional equivalent of pre-trial discovery and motion practice\" and were excluded from speedy trial calculations pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a> [4][a] (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v.

Khachiyan<\/i> , 194 Misc 2d 161 [Crim Ct, Kings County 2002] ). Furthermore, speedy trial precedent has long established that the People are entitled to a reasonable time to prepare for trial after an adjournment for motion practice ( <i>People v. Greene,<\/i> <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-greene-71\" class=\"raw-ref\">223 AD2d 474<\/a> [1st Dept 1996] ). Thus, prior to the enactment of the new criminal procedure laws, the People were routinely granted a period of excludable time to prepare for trial after rulings on an omnibus motion and demand to produce; here in Kings County, the same exclusion applied after the provision of DBS to prepare for trial and any hearings to be held on the consent of the People (<i>see<\/i> <i>Dorilas<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-dorilas\" class=\"raw-ref\">19 Misc 3d 75<\/a> ; <i>People v.

Notably, courts still applied this exclusion of time even when the People were not actually ready to prepare for trial (<i>Dorilas<\/i> , at 799)(reasonable period of delay resulting from DBS excluded \"despite the fact that the People had not yet converted the misdemeanor complaint\").<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"37\" id=\"pa37\">Under this established precedent, the adjournment from December 5th to January 10th, 2020 was not chargeable, as it falls squarely within the <i>Green<\/i> exclusion for trial preparation after DBS was provided by the People, and before the first scheduled date for hearing and trial. Defendant argues, however, that as of January 1, 2020, the People were rendered \"not ready,\" and should be charged until they met their discovery obligation and answered ready under the new standards.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"38\" id=\"pa38\"> Although the new trial readiness standards are applicable as of January 1, 2020, this does not mean that the speedy trial clock must automatically resume as of that date. The exclusion of motion practice as a \"reasonable period of delay for proceedings concerning the defendant\" from speedy trial calculations under Section [4] [a] of <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a> was not changed by the new legislation, and thus, can still be applicable to time periods where a motion is under consideration by the Court.<a note-disclosure=\"4\" href=\"#N300DB\"><\/a> Further, there is no dispute that under the pre-existing speedy trial laws, an adjournment following DBS was excludable: DBS stands in lieu of motion practice, and under <i>Green,<\/i> the People were not expected to be ready immediately upon determination of the motion or the provision of DBS.<a note-disclosure=\"5\" href=\"#N300E3\"><\/a>   <\/p><div note-container=\"4\" id=\"N300DB\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"39\" id=\"pa39\"> The Court notes that the 2020 discovery laws render adjournments for DBS and some discovery motion practice obsolete.

The People were not expected to be ready to start a trial until January 10th, and on that date, they filed a certificate of compliance and stated ready to proceed. The new discovery requirements and standards did not exist until after DBS was provided and after an adjournment was granted for hearing and trial. Because the case was in trial preparation posture immediately after DBS and the People exercised due diligence in meeting their discovery obligations under the 2020 standards on the first trial date, the Court finds the time period between December 5th and January 10th is properly excluded from the speedy trial clock under Section 4 [a] of <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a> and <i>Green<\/i> .<\/p> <h3>b) Adjournment from January 10, 2020 to February 5, 2020 for hearing and trial<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"44\" id=\"pa44\">The defendant also argues that the COC filed on January 10th was invalid, as the People did not provide the underlying OCME case file regarding the toxicology report, and therefore, the People's statement of readiness is inaccurate and should not serve to stop the speedy trial clock. (Def.'s Brief at 12).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"45\" id=\"pa45\">As a threshold matter, the Court finds that the OCME case file falls within the ambit of <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-245-discovery\/section-24520-automatic-discovery\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 245.20 (1) (j)<\/a> (see People v.

The record shows that the underlying case file for the toxicology report on the defendant's blood is material evidence currently unavailable to the People. The record also shows that the People have demonstrated due diligence in obtaining the toxicology report from OCME and in their attempts to acquire the underlying case file.

The record also reflects that prior to filing the COC, the People had completed their remaining discovery obligations.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"49\" id=\"pa49\">Moreover, the Court is satisfied on this record that the People were actually ready to proceed to trial on January 10th without relying upon the outstanding discovery material.

Romeo<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-romeo-4#p55\" class=\"raw-ref\">12 NY3d 51, 55<\/a> [2009] ; <i>People v. Staley<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-staley-1#p791\" class=\"raw-ref\">41 NY2d 789, 791-792<\/a> [1977] ). In determining whether a constitutional speedy trial violation has occurred, the Court must weigh five factors: (1) the extent of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the nature of the underlying charge; (4) the extent of pretrial incarceration; and (5) whether the defense was impaired by the delay (<i>see<\/i> <i>Taranovich<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-taranovich#p445\" class=\"raw-ref\">37 NY2d at 445<\/a> ). The Court evaluates these factors on an <i>ad hoc<\/i> basis, \"since no rigid precepts may be formulated which apply to each and every instance\" of an alleged constitutional right to speedy trial violation (<i>id.<\/i> ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"56\" id=\"pa56\">In this case, six months have elapsed from the time the defendant was arraigned until he filed the instant motion. The parties agree that at least 80 days of that time are chargeable to the People. The Court finds that under the facts of this case, any delays caused by the People's lack of readiness were not due to a lack of diligence by the People and were minimal. Indeed, the People answered ready multiple times over the pendency of the case. Specifically, the People filed an off-calendar statement of readiness upon conversion of the complaint within three months of the defendant's arraignment and then again answered ready on the first scheduled trial date on January 10, 2020.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"57\" id=\"pa57\">Neither the extent nor the reasons for the delay warrant dismissal. More egregious examples of delay in advancing towards trial have not warranted findings that the constitutional right to speedy trial has been violated (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v. Thompson<\/i> , 43 Misc 3d 136(A) [App Term 1st Dept 2014] (21-month delay, mostly resulting from court congestion and defendant's motion practice or unavailability, and where limited delay attributable to the People was not deliberate attempt to hamper defendant's preparation of his defense, did not justify dismissal of traffic infraction on speedy trial grounds); <i>People v. Polite<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-polite-23#p19\" class=\"raw-ref\">16 Misc 3d 18, 19<\/a> [App Term 1st Dept 2007] (no constitutional speedy trial violation where 18-month delay in prosecuting traffic infraction attributable to defendant's motion practice and court congestion, rather than to the People); <i>People v. Tejada<\/i> , 48 Misc 3d 1226(A) [Crim Ct Bronx County 2015] (one year delay, where only three court dates were scheduled for hearing and trial, did not warrant dismissal of traffic infraction).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"58\" id=\"pa58\"> Furthermore, defendant was not incarcerated on this offense, so the extent of pretrial incarceration is not a consideration here. Nor is impairment of defense a significant factor here. Although the police officer witness's ability to recollect details about his interaction with the defendant is likely lessened by the passage of time, there is also a greater likelihood that the defendant may create reasonable doubt as to the officer's testimony for this same reason.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"59\" id=\"pa59\">Having evaluated the particular facts and circumstances of this case under the <i>Tarantovich<\/i> factors, the Court finds that the defendant's constitutional speedy trial rights have not been violated. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on constitutional speedy trial grounds is DENIED.<\/p> <h3>III. MOTION TO CONTROVERT THE SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE SEIZED UPON ITS EXECUTION<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"61\" id=\"pa61\">Defendant argues that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause because the affidavit in support of the search warrant, sworn to by Police Officer Yukshing Chai, relies on the hearsay statements of the complainant, Margarita Quirindogo (<i>see<\/i> Def.'s Affirmation at pp. 4, 7-8). Defendant further argues that the People's failure to provide notice of the application for a search warrant is a violation of the defendant's due process rights requiring suppression of the obtained evidence (<i>id.<\/i> at 8-9).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"62\" id=\"pa62\">\"A presumption of validity attaches to a warrant, which has already been tested by the issuing Judge, thus simplifying the suppression court's task to determining whether the issuing Judge could reasonably have concluded that probable cause existed\" ( <i>People v. Ortiz<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-ortiz-248#p75\" class=\"raw-ref\">234 AD2d 74, 75-76<\/a> [1st Dept 1996] (citing <i>People v. Castillo<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-castillo-161#p585\" class=\"raw-ref\">80 NY2d 578, 585<\/a> [1992], <i>cert. denied<\/i> 507 US 1033 [1993] ). \"In New York State, courts determining the sufficiency of an affidavit submitted in support of a search warrant application that relies on hearsay information apply the two-prong <i>Aguilar-Spinelli<\/i> test\" ( <i>People v. Rhee<\/i> , 54 Misc 3d 1217(A), at *6 [Crim Ct New York County 2017], <i>citing<\/i> <i>People v. Griminger<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-griminger-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">71 NY2d 635<\/a> [1988] ). In the cases concerning a citizen informant, a substantial basis for crediting his reliability and his conclusion that illegal activities were taking place is \"built in\" ( <i>People v. Cantre<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-cantre\" class=\"raw-ref\">95 AD2d 522<\/a> [2nd Dept 1983] citing <i>US v. Nilsen<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/united-states-v-nilsen\" class=\"raw-ref\">482 F. Supp. 1335<\/a> [D NJ 1980] ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"63\" id=\"pa63\">Here, the issuing judge was presented with evidence that Officer Chai responded to a 911 call made by the complainant reporting a car collision with the defendant's motorcycle. The officer's affidavit describes information relayed directly from the complainant that the defendant \"disobeyed the pavement markings and went straight ahead colliding with the witness\" (Def.'s Brief, exhibit B, p.3). Further, the officer observed the defendant with head injuries at the scene and again later at Methodist Hospital, where the defendant was treated for injuries from the collision. At the hospital when Officer Chai attempted to interview the defendant, he observed the defendant to have slurred speech and alcohol on his breath and heard the defendant admit to hospital staff that he had 2 beers earlier that evening (<i>id.<\/i> at 5). The information contained in the 911 call combined with the officer's observations of the defendant's injury, his intoxicated condition and the defendant's admission of drinking earlier that night were sufficient to establish the reliability of the informant and provided ample basis for the issuance of probable cause that the defendant was driving while intoxicated by alcohol.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"64\" id=\"pa64\"> The defendant further argues that the People's failure to provide notice of the search warrant application violated his right to due process and requires suppression of the blood sample pursuant to the Court of Appeals holding in <i>Matter of Abe A<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-abe-a-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">56 NY2d 288<\/a> [1982]. The Court disagrees. As a general rule, an <i>ex parte<\/i> application for a search warrant is lawful, \"since the target of a search warrant has no right to notice or an opportunity to be heard on the application\" ( <i>People v. McNair<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-mcnair-8\" class=\"raw-ref\">85 AD3d 693<\/a> [1st Dept 2011]. <i>Abe A<\/i> and its progeny establish special rules for evidence taken from a suspect's body, such as blood or DNA samples ( <i>People v. Goldman<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-goldman-78\" class=\"raw-ref\">171 AD3d 581<\/a>, [1st Dept 2019] ; <i>see<\/i> <i>also<\/i> <i>People v. Smith<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-smith-4787\" class=\"raw-ref\">95 AD3d 21<\/a> [4th Dept 2012] ; <i>People v. Halle<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-halle-12\" class=\"raw-ref\">57 Misc 3d 335<\/a> [Sup Ct, Kings County 2017] ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"65\" id=\"pa65\">The search warrant at issue authorized the seizure of a stored blood sample which had been drawn by the hospital during the course of the defendant's treatment for injury sustained during a car accident on the date of the incident. The concerns of <i>Abe A<\/i> are not implicated here since the warrant application in this case did not concern any new intrusion into the defendant's body (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v. King<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-king-379\" class=\"raw-ref\">232 AD2d 111<\/a> [2nd Dept 1997] (scientific analysis of a lawfully obtained blood sample does not involve any further search and seizure of a defendant's person); <i>cf.<\/i> <i>Smith<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-smith-4787\" class=\"raw-ref\">95 AD3d 21<\/a> [4th Dept 2012] (notice required for successive applications to produce defendant for buccal swab)). As such, the defendant was not entitled to notice and the <i>ex parte<\/i> procedure was lawful pursuant to CPL \u00a7 690.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"66\" id=\"pa66\">Accordingly, the defendant's motion to controvert the search warrant and suppress the evidence obtained therefrom is DENIED.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"67\" id=\"pa67\">The foregoing constitutes the opinion, decision and order of the Court.<\/p> <p class=\"empty-paragraph\"><\/p> <p class=\"empty-paragraph\"><\/p> <\/section><hr> <\/section>","title":"<p><span class=\"font-weight-bold mr-1\">Full title:<\/span>The People of the State of New York, Plaintiff, v.

We likewise reject defendant's contention that the court erred in admitting into evidence a composite tape recording of various telephone calls made or received by defendant or codefendant. Although the tape recording included conversations involving uncharged drug crimes, it was properly admitted to prove that defendant knowingly possessed over four ounces of cocaine with the intent to sell it <i>(see, People v.

The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree, and imposed sentence. The appeal brings up for review so much of an order of that court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) dated October 11, 2018 as, upon reargument, adhered to a prior determination of that court (Toni M.

Cimino, J.) dated October 11, 2018, which, upon reargument, adhered to that court's May 24, 2018 order (Toni M. Cimino, J.) denying defendant's April 9, 2018 motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on statutory speedy trial grounds, finding that only 84 days were chargeable to the People, which is less than the 90 days allotted to them in this matter (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 30.30<\/a> [1] [b]). Of particular relevance here is the period from January 12, 2018 through April 9, 2018. On January 12, 2018, the People answered not ready for trial. The Criminal Court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) adjourned the trial to February 20, 2018 and required the People, who had previously declared readiness, to file and serve a certificate of readiness (CoR) in order to stop the statutory speedy trial clock. On February 20, 2018, the prosecutor answered not ready and requested a one-week adjournment. The trial was adjourned to April 11, 2018, and the court (Jerry M. Iannece, J.) told the prosecutor that, if the People were not ready on that date, \"I will charge you with all time until you are ready.\" The April 11 trial date was adjourned because defendant filed his initial speedy trial motion on April 9, 2018. In denying the motion and finding that the People were chargeable with a total of 84 days, the court charged the entire 39-day period of January 12-February 20, 2018, but only charged the 7 days requested by the People for the period of February 20-April 9, 2018, rather than charging the full time through April 9, 2018. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\"> On appeal, defendant argues, among other things, that, because the People did not file a CoR in accordance with the Criminal Court's January 12, 2018 directive, all time from January 12 to April 9, 2018 should have been charged. The People respond that, because defendant did not mention on February 20, 2018 that the People were still required to file a CoR when the prosecutor answered not ready and requested a one-week adjournment, and the court did not refuse the People's request, the People were no longer bound by the court's January 12, 2018 order. We disagree. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"15\" id=\"pa15\"> The People were given a clear, unequivocal, and reasonable order on January 12, 2018 to provide a CoR in order to stop the statutory speedy trial clock from running. The prosecutor failed to abide by this requirement, and neither the court's apparent unawareness thereof on February 20, 2018 nor defendant's admittedly involved participation that day in setting the next adjournment date on April 11, 2018 absolved the People of this CoR obligation. Consequently, all the time from February 20 to April 9, 2018 should have been charged, not just the 7 days the People requested. Therefore, an additional 41 days (not including the 7 days already accounted for in the court's total) must be added to the People's chargeable time, which results in the People being charged with a total of 125 days (84 + 41). As there were more than 90 chargeable days in this case, dismissal of the accusatory instrument is mandated. Defendant's other appellate contentions are rendered academic, and we decline to address them. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"16\" id=\"pa16\"> Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is reversed and, upon reargument, defendant's motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on statutory speedy trial grounds is granted. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"17\" id=\"pa17\"> WESTON, J.P., and TOUSSAINT, J., concur. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"18\" id=\"pa18\"> GOLIA, J., dissents and votes to affirm the judgment of conviction in the following memorandum: <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"19\" id=\"pa19\"> After having previously announced their readiness, the People declared in court on January 12, 2018 that they were not ready to proceed to trial and requested a one-week adjournment to January 19th. The Criminal Court (Toni M. Cimino, J.), explaining that \"the People answered not ready on the last occasion and also requested a very short adjournment,\" upon granting the People's request for an adjournment, stated that the statutory speedy trial clock would run until the People filed a Certificate of Readiness (CoR) to stop it. On the next appearance date, February 20, 2018, the People, who had not filed a CoR in the interim, again announced their nonreadiness to proceed and requested a one-week adjournment. The court (Jerry M. Iannece, J.) adjourned the matter to April 11, 2018 but directed the People \"to be ready [for trial] on this one. You have to be ready.... You are not ready today. Next time I will charge you with all time until you are ready\" (emphasis added). On April 9, 2018, defendant made his initial speedy trial motion which was denied by the court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) by order dated May 24, 2018. The court charged the People with a total of 84 days, which included the entirety of the January 12-February 20, 2018 adjournment period (39 days) and only the 7 days requested by the People for the time period between February 20 and the April 9, 2018 motion. Upon reargument, the May 24, 2018 determination was adhered to by order (Toni M. Cimino, J.) dated October 11, 2018. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"20\" id=\"pa20\"> Defendant first argues, in effect, that the court's January 12, 2018 order directing the People to file a CoR to stop the speedy trial clock was the law of the case and therefore governed the February 20-April 9, 2018 period. Defendant submits that, since the People had not filed a CoR, the court improvidently exercised its discretion by charging only seven days of this adjournment period instead of enforcing its own order by charging the entirety thereof against the People, which extra days cause the People to exceed their statutory speedy trial time. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"21\" id=\"pa21\"> Generally \"law of the case does not apply when a court alters its own ruling, as opposed to the ruling of another court of coordinate jurisdiction\" (<i>Commercial Tenant Servs., Inc. v Northern Leasing Sys., Inc.<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/commercial-tenant-servs-inc-v-n-leasing-sys-inc#p897\" class=\"raw-ref\">131 A.D.3d 895, 897<\/a> [2015] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Consequently, it was not an improvident exercise of discretion for Judge Cimino, who issued both the CoR requirement on January 12, 2018 and the October 11, 2018 order adhering to her prior order denying defendant's statutory speedy trial motion, to decline to enforce her own CoR ruling and instead charge only the seven-day adjournment that the People requested on February 20, 2018. Indeed, Judge Cimino's decision denying defendant's speedy trial motion was appropriate because, as Judge Cimino found, \"the People may have reasonably relied upon\" Judge Iannece's February 20, 2018 statement. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"22\" id=\"pa22\"> Contrary to defendant's other statutory speedy trial argument, the People's explanation that they were not ready to proceed to trial at the January 12 and February 20, 2018 court appearances because they were attempting to procure surveillance camera footage did not, without more, render their previous statements of readiness per se illusory. \"There is nothing in <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 30.30<\/a> to preclude the People from declaring their present readiness, but still gathering additional evidence to strengthen their case....

Sciarrino, J., at speedy trial motion; James M. Burke, J., at trial), rendered November 17, 2011, after a jury trial, convicting him of resisting arrest and driving while impaired, and imposing sentence. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"7\" id=\"pa7\">Per Curiam. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"8\" id=\"pa8\">Judgment of conviction (Matthew A. Sciarrino, J., at speedy trial motion; James M. Burke, J., at trial), rendered November 17, 2011, affirmed. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"9\" id=\"pa9\">The court properly denied defendant's statutory speedy trial motion. After the People announced they were ready to proceed on the scheduled hearing and trial date, defense counsel did not request any adjournment and stated he could proceed that afternoon. Defense counsel then announced that \"I'm going to serve and file a 30.30 motion.\" Under these circumstances, we agree with Criminal Court that \"defense counsel's tactics deprived the prosecution of reasonable notice of the motion, and that the defendant waived his speedy trial claim by announcing his readiness ... and by failing to request an adjournment when the People moved the case to trial that morning\" (<i>People v Harvall<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-harvall-2#p555\" class=\"raw-ref\">196 AD2d 553, 555<\/a> [1993], <i>lv denied<\/i> 82 NY2d 896 [1993]); <i>see People v Alvarez<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-daniel-29\" class=\"raw-ref\">46 AD3d 476<\/a> [2007], <i>lv denied<\/i> 10 NY3d 807 [2008]; <i>People v Goberdhan<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-goberdhan\" class=\"raw-ref\">249 AD2d 324<\/a> [1998], <i>lv denied<\/i> 92 NY2d 852 [1998]; <i>People v Baxter<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-baxter-10\" class=\"raw-ref\">216 AD2d 931<\/a> [1995]). Moreover, because the underlying speedy trial motion is not contained in the record on appeal, review of the merits of defendant's 30.30 claim is precluded (<i>see People v Bergman<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-bergman-9#p1495\" class=\"raw-ref\">70 AD3d 1494, 1495<\/a> [2010], <i>lv denied<\/i> 14 NY3d 885 [2010]; <i>People v Highsmith<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-highsmith-14#p770\" class=\"raw-ref\">254 AD2d 768, 770<\/a> [1998], <i>lv denied<\/i> 92 NY2d 983 [1998]). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\">Defendant's claim that the trial court erroneously denied his for cause challenge to a prospective juror is unpreserved for appellate review, as defense counsel failed to challenge the prospective juror on the specific ground asserted on appeal (<i>see People v Campbell<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-campbell-807\" class=\"raw-ref\">111 AD3d 760<\/a> [2013]).

However, those arguments are unavailing on the merits.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\"> First, defendant contends that the parties' contract violates <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-real-property\/article-12-a-real-estate-brokers-and-real-estate-salespersons\/section-440-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">Real Property Law \u00a7\u00a7 440(1)<\/a> and <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-real-property\/article-12-a-real-estate-brokers-and-real-estate-salespersons\/section-440-a-license-required-for-real-estate-brokers-and-salespersons\" class=\"raw-ref\">440\u2013a<\/a>. However, article 12\u2013A of the Real Property Law, which includes <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-real-property\/article-12-a-real-estate-brokers-and-real-estate-salespersons\/section-440-definitions\" class=\"raw-ref\">sections 440<\/a> and <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-real-property\/article-12-a-real-estate-brokers-and-real-estate-salespersons\/section-440-a-license-required-for-real-estate-brokers-and-salespersons\" class=\"raw-ref\">440\u2013a<\/a>, \u201cshould be strictly construed\u201d (<i>Reiter v.

Plaintiff's services, which primarily consisted of finding overcharges, \u201cfall outside the scope of real estate brokerage services\u201d (<i>Eaton Assoc. v.

Since the contract was drafted by plaintiff (it takes the form of a letter from plaintiff to defendant), we construe the ambiguity in defendant's favor (<i>see e.g. <\/i> <i>151 West Assoc. v.

The defendant waived pre-trial motions and the case was adjourned to March 18, 2019 for trial. On each of the next two trial dates (March 18, 2019 and May 6, 2019), the People were not ready for trial and indicated that they would file and serve an off-calendar statement of readiness if and when they became ready. On May 16, 2019, the People filed a statement of readiness with the court.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\">At the next scheduled court appearance, June 20, 2019, the case was called to the calendar four separate times. On the first call, the People stated not ready for trial, and represented that they had once again lost contact with a complaining witness. Upon the court's inquiry, the People specified that the assigned Assistant District Attorney had made telephone contact with a necessary witness on May 15, 2019 but had subsequently failed to reach her on May 28 and June 17. Based on that representation, the court ruled that the People were to be charged the full time from the previous court date. Defense counsel indicated that by her count, the People had thus exceeded their statutory speedy trial time.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\">At the second call of the case, the parties stood in agreement that should the court's ruling stand, the People would be in excess of their speedy trial time. However, the People maintained their position that the May 16 statement of readiness was filed in good faith and as such, should have tolled the speedy time clock. On that record, the court, <i>sua sponte<\/i> , dismissed the case pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a>[1][b].<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"15\" id=\"pa15\">At the third calendar call, the People made an application to restore the case to the calendar in order to provide them an opportunity to respond to a written motion from the defendant, pursuant to <i>People v. Alvarez<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-daniel-29\" class=\"raw-ref\">46 A.D.3d 476<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-daniel-29\" class=\"raw-ref\">849 N.Y.S.2d 207<\/a> (1st Dept. 2007), which the court granted. The assigned Assistant District Attorney, appearing for the first time, made the additional record that the complaining witnesses in the case had been present <span page-number=\"917\" pagination-id=\"65 Misc. 3d 914\" id=\"p917\"><\/span> that morning in his office in response to the <span page-number=\"818\" pagination-id=\"110 N.Y.S.3d 814\" id=\"p818\"><\/span> People's notice to appear. The assigned Assistant, however, had not been able to convey that new information to the Assistants present in the courtroom during the first two calls. The People represented that despite the presence of the complainants, they were not changing their trial readiness status for the day. The court adjourned the case to July 16, 2019 for motion practice on the speedy trial issue.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"16\" id=\"pa16\">Finally, on the fourth calendar call, defense counsel withdrew her request for a motion schedule and requested an adjournment for trial. The People requested the following day for trial, but defense counsel reiterated their request for July 16, 2019 as a trial date. The court adjourned the case to July 16, 2019 for trial.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"17\" id=\"pa17\">The parties agree that discovery was served upon the defendant in two parts, the first on May 6, 2019 and the second on June 20, 2019. On July 8, 2019, defense counsel notified the People and the court that based upon her review of the discovery, the defendant was of the position that proper conversion of the complaint to an information required a certificate of translation. On July 16, 2019, the People filed with the court and served upon the defendant two affidavits of translation signed by Wilfredo Izaguirre, one for each complainant. In each affidavit, Mr. Izaguirre states that he is fluent in both English and Spanish, that he is employed as a Spanish interpreter by the Bronx District Attorney's office, and that he interpreted and translated the contents of the criminal court complaint and supporting deposition for each complainant on July 15, 2019. The People asserted their trial readiness on the record.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"18\" id=\"pa18\">The defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss on July 16, 2019 and the People filed their opposition on August 1, 2019. With the court's leave, the defendant filed his reply to the People's opposition on August 7, 2019, and the People filed a supplemental response on August 8, 2019.<\/p> <h3>The Parties' Contentions<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"20\" id=\"pa20\">The defendant's motion to dismiss is based on two main arguments. First, the defendant argues that the People should be charged for the period between March 18, 2019 and July 16, 2019 despite the People's May 16 statement of readiness. The defendant maintains that the People's May 16 statement of readiness was rendered illusory by the People's subsequent <span page-number=\"918\" pagination-id=\"65 Misc. 3d 914\" id=\"p918\"><\/span> unready status at their next appearance on June 20, 2019. The defendant also challenges the form of the May 16 statement of readiness, arguing that the statement was ineffective in that it failed to specify which complainant had been successfully contacted by the People.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"21\" id=\"pa21\">Second, the defendant argues that the People should be charged for the entire period between the defendant's Criminal Court arraignment on March 3, 2019 and July 16, 2019 because the People failed to properly convert the criminal complaint into an information. The defendant claims that material received from the People in discovery provides sufficient indicia that neither complainant is able to speak, read, or understand English, and therefore the complainants were unable to properly verify the accusatory instrument. The defendant thus contends that without affidavits of translation, the instrument did not comply with the requirements of <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-h-preliminary-proceedings-in-local-criminal-court\/article-100-commencement-of-action-in-local-criminal-court-local-criminal-court-accusatory-instruments\/section-10010-local-criminal-court-and-youth-part-of-the-superior-court-accusatory-instruments-definitions-thereof\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7\u00a7 100.10<\/a> and <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-h-preliminary-proceedings-in-local-criminal-court\/article-100-commencement-of-action-in-local-criminal-court-local-criminal-court-accusatory-instruments\/section-10015-information-misdemeanor-complaint-and-felony-complaint-form-and-content\" class=\"raw-ref\">100.15(1)<\/a> and remained unconverted.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"22\" id=\"pa22\">In response, the People first argue that the defendant's motion to dismiss is untimely as it was filed beyond the forty-five-day limitation laid out by <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-255-pre-trial-motions\/section-25520-pre-trial-motions-procedure\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 255.20<\/a>. The People further contend that the accusatory instrument and supporting depositions in this case are facially sufficient and thus jurisdictionally valid without certificates of translation. The People also argue <span page-number=\"819\" pagination-id=\"110 N.Y.S.3d 814\" id=\"p819\"><\/span> that requiring an affidavit of translation for a complainant who speaks and understands English but is unable to read it may constitute impermissible discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 11 of the New York State Constitution. In the alternative, the People assert that in filing the affidavits of translation of July 16, 2019, they have cured any perceived deficiencies and no further remedy is necessary.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"23\" id=\"pa23\">With respect to the May 16 statement of readiness, the People maintain that as the assigned Assistant District Attorney had reestablished contact with the complainants the day before its filing, the statement was made in good faith and thus, should not be deemed illusory, notwithstanding the People's subsequent unready status.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"24\" id=\"pa24\">The court finds that the defendant's motion is not time-barred. The court also finds that the People have failed to timely cure a demonstrated latent defect in the accusatory instrument, and thus are beyond their speedy trial allowance pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a>. Accordingly, the defendant's motion to dismiss is granted. <span page-number=\"919\" pagination-id=\"65 Misc. 3d 914\" id=\"p919\"><\/span> <b>Analysis<\/b> <\/p> <h3>Timeliness of the Defendant's Motion<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"26\" id=\"pa26\"> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-255-pre-trial-motions\/section-25520-pre-trial-motions-procedure\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 255.20 (1)<\/a> provides, in relevant part, that \"all pre-trial motions shall be served or filed within forty-five days after arraignment and before commencement of trial, or within such additional time as the court may fix upon application of the defendant made prior to entry of judgment.\" However, the same statute also provides that notwithstanding subsection (1), \"[T]he court must entertain and decide on its merits, at anytime before the end of the trial, any appropriate pre-trial motion based upon grounds of which the defendant could not, with due diligence, have been previously aware, or which, for other good cause, could not reasonably have been raised within the period specified in subdivision one of this section\" ( <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-255-pre-trial-motions\/section-25520-pre-trial-motions-procedure\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 255.20<\/a> [3 ] ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"27\" id=\"pa27\">Here, the People argue that the defendant's motion should be barred as untimely as it was filed beyond the forty-five-day period contemplated by <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-j-prosecution-of-indictments-in-superior-courts-plea-to-sentence\/article-255-pre-trial-motions\/section-25520-pre-trial-motions-procedure\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 255.20<\/a>. The People's position is that because defense counsel could have learned from the defendant whether the complainants' English-language abilities were sufficient to adequately subscribe and verify the accusatory instrument, waiting until over one hundred days after arraignment to first raise the issue does not constitute \"due diligence\" and thus the defendant has not shown good cause for the delay.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"28\" id=\"pa28\">The defendant, on the other hand, asserts that defense counsel became aware that the complainants did not speak, read, or understand English only upon receipt and review of the discovery materials disclosed by the People on May 6, 2019 and June 20, 2019, respectively. While defense counsel does not address what, if any, information was provided to her by the defendant prior to her review of the discovery, she does lay out clearly which specific items supported her conclusion that the complainants' English-language skills were inadequate: first, Domestic Incident Reports (DIRs) received on May 6, 2019, handwritten by the complainants in Spanish, and then, received on June 20, 2019, 911 recordings revealing a conversation conducted entirely in Spanish, and third, body-worn camera footage showing police officers unsuccessfully attempt to interact with the complainants in English before eventually relying on translations by a bilingual police officer. Defense counsel avers that it was only after reviewing these items that she could reasonably conclude <span page-number=\"820\" pagination-id=\"110 N.Y.S.3d 814\" id=\"p820\"><\/span> that a certificate of translation was required. <span page-number=\"920\" pagination-id=\"65 Misc. 3d 914\" id=\"p920\"><\/span> While defense counsel certainly had access to information about the complainants through her client, it is not a given that simply because the parties were well known to each other that the defendant would have perfect knowledge of both complainants' English-language skills. It is similarly not a given that the defendant's information alone would have been sufficient to support the instant application (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v. Honshj<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-honshj#p175\" class=\"raw-ref\">176 Misc. 2d 170, 175<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-honshj\" class=\"raw-ref\">671 N.Y.S.2d 934<\/a> [Crim. Ct., Kings County 1998] [\"defendant's <i>mere speculation<\/i> that the complainant \u2018might\u2019 not have read or understood the allegations in the complaint is insufficient to successfully challenge the propriety of the supporting deposition\"]. However, the discovery items described by defense counsel\u2014the Spanish-language DIRs combined with the all-Spanish conversations between the complainants, police officers, and the 911 operator\u2014provided defense counsel with a reliable factual basis for her conclusions about the complainants' English-language abilities, which she could not have had prior to the disclosure of the discovery materials. The eighteen-day period between when defense counsel received the discovery and communicating her position to the People was a reasonable length of time for defense counsel to review and analyze the discovery and then to communicate the defense position to the People. Therefore, this court finds that the defendant has shown good cause for why the instant motion could not have been brought at an earlier date and will consider the defendant's application on its merits.<\/p> <h3>Latent Defects<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"30\" id=\"pa30\"> Where criminal charges are commenced by way of misdemeanor complaint, the complaint must first be converted into an information that, together with any supporting depositions: (1) alleges facts of an evidentiary character supporting or tending to support the charges, pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-h-preliminary-proceedings-in-local-criminal-court\/article-100-commencement-of-action-in-local-criminal-court-local-criminal-court-accusatory-instruments\/section-10015-information-misdemeanor-complaint-and-felony-complaint-form-and-content\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 100.15(3)<\/a> ; (2) provides reasonable cause to believe that the defendant committed the offenses charged in the information; and (3) includes non-hearsay factual allegations which, if true, establish every element of the offense charged (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-h-preliminary-proceedings-in-local-criminal-court\/article-100-commencement-of-action-in-local-criminal-court-local-criminal-court-accusatory-instruments\/section-10040-local-criminal-court-and-youth-part-of-the-superior-court-accusatory-instruments-sufficiency-on-face\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 100.40<\/a>[1][a]-[c] ).

A supporting deposition is \"a written instrument accompanying or filed in connection with\" a criminal complaint, and \"subscribed and verified by a person other than the complainant of such instrument, and containing factual allegations of an evidentiary character, based either upon personal knowledge or upon information and belief, which supplement those of the accusatory instrument and support or tend to support the charge or charges contained therein\" ( <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-2-the-principal-proceedings\/title-h-preliminary-proceedings-in-local-criminal-court\/article-100-commencement-of-action-in-local-criminal-court-local-criminal-court-accusatory-instruments\/section-10020-supporting-deposition-definition-form-and-content\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 100.20<\/a> ). When a supporting deposition is signed by a witness who has not reviewed the contents of the complaint or who does not speak or read English, it contains hearsay as it does not reflect the witness' statements, but rather \"[law enforcement's] interpretation\" of the witness' statements ( <i>Matter of Edward B.<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-edward-b#p463\" class=\"raw-ref\">80 N.Y.2d 458, 463<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-edward-b\" class=\"raw-ref\">591 N.Y.S.2d 962<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/matter-of-edward-b\" class=\"raw-ref\">606 N.E.2d 1353<\/a> [1992] ).

Camacho<\/i> , 185 Misc. 2d 31, 36, 711 N.Y.S.2d 283 [Crim. Ct., Kings County 2000] ); <i>see also<\/i> <i>People v. Case<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-case-9\" class=\"raw-ref\">42 N.Y.2d 98<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-case-9\" class=\"raw-ref\">396 N.Y.S.2d 841<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-case-9\" class=\"raw-ref\">365 N.E.2d 872<\/a> [1977] ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"37\" id=\"pa37\"> Here, defense counsel, having reviewed discovery materials received by the People, concluded that the complainants in this case were incapable of confirming the veracity and accuracy of the English-language accusatory instrument and supporting deposition without the assistance of a Spanish-language interpreter. Notably, the People do not dispute the defendant's representation, but filed two affidavits of translation before the court had an opportunity to address the issue. The People's filing of the affidavits without contesting the defendant's representation regarding the complainants' English-language skills is an implicit concession that the assistance of a Spanish-language interpreter was necessary (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v. Reyes<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-reyes-2041\" class=\"raw-ref\">60 Misc. 3d 245<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-reyes-2041\" class=\"raw-ref\">76 N.Y.S.3d 385<\/a> [Crim. Ct., Queens County 2018] ). Accordingly, this court finds that a certificate of translation is necessary in this case to ascertain the legitimacy of the complainants' verification and thus this court's jurisdiction over the case (<i>see, e.g.<\/i> <i>People v. Allen<\/i> , 63 Misc. 3d 159(A), 2019 WL 2364339 [App. Term, 1st Dept. 2019] ; <i>People v. Hernandez<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-hernandez-1455\" class=\"raw-ref\">47 Misc. 3d 51<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-hernandez-1455\" class=\"raw-ref\">7 N.Y.S.3d 822<\/a> [App. Term, 1st Dept. 2015]. Without a certificate or affidavit of translation, the criminal court complaint could not be converted into an information and any subsequent statements of readiness by the People are illusory ( <i>People v. Reyes<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-reyes-2041\" class=\"raw-ref\">60 Misc. 3d 245<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-reyes-2041\" class=\"raw-ref\">76 N.Y.S.3d 385<\/a> [Crim. Ct., Queens County 2018] ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"38\" id=\"pa38\">The People have argued in the alternative that in filing the July 16, 2019 affidavits of translation, they have cured any perceived defects and no further remedy is required. Each affidavit is signed by Wilfredo Izaguirre, who attests that: (1) he is <span page-number=\"924\" pagination-id=\"65 Misc. 3d 914\" id=\"p924\"><\/span> fluent in both English and Spanish, (2) he is able to interpret and translate between these two languages and has experience doing so in the past, (3) he is employed by the Office of the Bronx District Attorney's Office as a Spanish interpreter, meets the requisite qualifications, and was raised with Spanish as his primary language, (4) on July 15, 2019, he interpreted and translated the language in the instant complaint from English to Spanish for the named <span page-number=\"823\" pagination-id=\"110 N.Y.S.3d 814\" id=\"p823\"><\/span> complainant, (5) he did so accurately, clearly, and completely, and (6) after doing so, the complainant stated that she understood what was interpreted. These affidavits clearly indicate that a qualified interpreter, fluent in both English and Spanish, properly conveyed the contents of the accusatory instrument to both complainants. However, the affidavits indicate that he did so on July 15, 2019, over four months after the documents were originally signed by the complainants.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"39\" id=\"pa39\">This may have sufficed, had the affidavits of translation referred back to the complainants' initial signing of the complaint and supporting deposition on March 3, 2019. If the affidavits so indicated, then this court may be assured that on that date, the complainants were given the opportunity to review the documents' contents for their truth and accuracy, and from there conclude that the instrument was properly converted into an information. However, these affidavits indicate <i>only<\/i> that the contents in the complaint and supporting deposition were translated to the complainants on July 15, 2019. No reference is made to the date of original signing. Without some attestation that on March 3, 2019, the contents of the complaint and supporting deposition were accurately translated from English to Spanish for the complainants to review, this court cannot conclude that the complaint was properly verified and thus that it was a jurisdictionally valid information.<a note-disclosure=\"1\" href=\"#N30136\"><\/a>  <\/p><div note-container=\"1\" id=\"N30136\"> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"40\" id=\"pa40\"> Further, the affidavit of translation relating to complainant Ramirez suffers an additional deficiency. Where complainant Alvarado signed the criminal court complaint itself, complainant Ramirez signed a separate supporting deposition, which makes reference to the criminal court complaint but does not include the complaint's substantive allegations. Therefore, an effective affidavit of translation must establish that the complainant was read the contents of the supporting deposition, including the jurat, at the time she affixed her signature. However, while the affidavit of translation for complainant Ramirez references having interpreted and translated \"the entire content of the accusatory instrument\" in type (matching the rest of the affidavit), the phrase \"and supporting deposition\" has been added to the line, handwritten and in blue ink. There are no initials or other indication as to who added this handwritten phrase or when it was added, and the ink does not match the color of the ink used by the interpreter who ultimately signed the affidavit. While this court need not conclude at this time whether this handwritten amendment would suffice to establish that the supporting deposition was actually translated to the complainant, it bears noting that it nonetheless casts needless ambiguity on the issue.<br> <\/p> <\/div> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"41\" id=\"pa41\">Based on the defendant's uncontradicted representations that the complainants required a Spanish-language interpreter <span page-number=\"925\" pagination-id=\"65 Misc. 3d 914\" id=\"p925\"><\/span> to understand and verify the contents of the accusatory instrument and supporting deposition, a certificate or affidavit of translation was a necessary prerequisite to full conversion. Because the People have failed to establish that either complainant reviewed the accusatory instrument for its truth and accuracy on or prior to March 3, 2019, the date on which the complainants signed their respective documents, this court finds that the accusatory instrument was not properly converted to an information on that date.<\/p> <h3>Speedy Trial Implications<\/h3> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"43\" id=\"pa43\">Where, as here, the top count charged in an accusatory instrument is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail, the People are required to be ready for trial within ninety days of the defendant's arraignment, less any excludable time ( <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a>[1][b] ).

At that point, the People are deemed ready for trial only if they have stated their readiness in open court or by written notice to defense counsel and the Court ( <i>People v.

However, the People cannot be ready on a facially insufficient or an unconverted misdemeanor complaint ( <i>People v.

Berkowitz<\/i> , <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-berkowitz-2#p349\" class=\"raw-ref\">50 N.Y.2d 333, 349<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-berkowitz-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">428 N.Y.S.2d 927<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-berkowitz-2\" class=\"raw-ref\">406 N.E.2d 783<\/a> [1980] ). The People must identify the statutory exclusions on which they are relying to bring them within the statutory time limit for declaring readiness (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v.

Further, the People have the burden of making <span page-number=\"926\" pagination-id=\"65 Misc. 3d 914\" id=\"p926\"><\/span> a record sufficient to enable the court to make a determination as to each adjournment ( <i>id.<\/i> at 215-16, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-cortes-13\" class=\"raw-ref\">590 N.Y.S.2d 9<\/a>, <a href=\"\/case\/people-v-cortes-13\" class=\"raw-ref\">604 N.E.2d 71<\/a> ). If the statutorily prescribed period elapses without sufficient excludable time established, the charges at issue must be dismissed upon motion by the defendant ( <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7\u00a7 30.30<\/a>[1] ; 210.20).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"45\" id=\"pa45\"> Here, as discussed above, the People have failed to establish that the criminal court complaint and supporting deposition were properly verified on the day those documents were signed, March 3, 2019. Because the accusatory instrument was never properly verified, the People never had a fully converted and thus jurisdictionally valid information upon which to state ready. Therefore, any statements of trial readiness by the People prior to July 15, 2019 were illusory and ineffective (<i>see<\/i> <i>People v.

Ct., Queens County 2018] ).<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"46\" id=\"pa46\">The People have identified no statutory basis for excludable time during the period from March 4, 2019, the defendant's initial arraignment, and July 16, 2019, the date on which they filed the affidavits of translation and stated their trial readiness on the record.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"47\" id=\"pa47\">Based on the foregoing, the court finds the period from March 4, 2019 and July 16, 2019 chargeable to the People pursuant to <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL \u00a7 30.30<\/a>. The People are thus charged with a total of <i>134 days<\/i> , beyond the statutory limitation. Accordingly, the defendant's motion to dismiss is granted.

The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree, and imposed sentence. The appeal brings up for review so much of an order of that court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) dated October 11, 2018 as, upon reargument, adhered to a prior determination of that court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) in an order dated May 24, 2018 denying defendant's motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on statutory speedy trial grounds. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\"> ORDERED that the judgment of conviction is reversed, on the law, and, upon reargument, defendant's motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on statutory speedy trial grounds is granted. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\"> Defendant was charged with petit larceny <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-penal\/part-3-specific-offenses\/title-j-offenses-involving-theft\/article-155-larceny\/section-15525-petit-larceny\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Penal Law \u00a7 155.25<\/a>) and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-penal\/part-3-specific-offenses\/title-j-offenses-involving-theft\/article-165-other-offenses-relating-to-theft\/section-16540-criminal-possession-of-stolen-property-in-the-fifth-degree\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Penal Law \u00a7 165.40<\/a>), and, after a jury trial, defendant was convicted of both counts and sentence was imposed. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\"> On appeal, defendant contests, among other things, an order of the Criminal Court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) dated October 11, 2018, which, upon reargument, adhered to that court's May 24, 2018 order (Toni M. Cimino, J.) denying defendant's April 9, 2018 motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on statutory speedy trial grounds, finding that only 84 days were chargeable to the People, which is less than the 90 days allotted to them in this matter (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 30.30<\/a> [1] [b]). Of particular relevance here is the period from January 12, 2018 through April 9, 2018. On January 12, 2018, the People answered not ready for trial. The Criminal Court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) adjourned the trial to February 20, 2018 and required the People, who had previously declared readiness, to file and serve a certificate of readiness (CoR) in order to stop the statutory speedy trial clock. On February 20, 2018, the prosecutor answered not ready and requested a one-week adjournment. The trial was adjourned to April 11, 2018, and the court (Jerry M. Iannece, J.) told the prosecutor that, if the People were not ready on that date, \"I will charge you with all time until you are ready.\" The April 11 trial date was adjourned because defendant filed his initial speedy trial motion on April 9, 2018. In denying the motion and finding that the People were chargeable with a total of 84 days, the court charged the entire 39-day period of January 12-February 20, 2018, but only charged the 7 days requested by the People for the period of February 20-April 9, 2018, rather than charging the full time through April 9, 2018. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\"> On appeal, defendant argues, among other things, that, because the People did not file a CoR in accordance with the Criminal Court's January 12, 2018 directive, all time from January 12 to April 9, 2018 should have been charged. The People respond that, because defendant did not mention on February 20, 2018 that the People were still required to file a CoR when the prosecutor answered not ready and requested a one-week adjournment, and the court did not refuse the People's request, the People were no longer bound by the court's January 12, 2018 order. We disagree. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"15\" id=\"pa15\"> The People were given a clear, unequivocal, and reasonable order on January 12, 2018 to provide a CoR in order to stop the statutory speedy trial clock from running. The prosecutor failed to abide by this requirement, and neither the court's apparent unawareness thereof on February 20, 2018 nor defendant's admittedly involved participation that day in setting the next adjournment date on April 11, 2018 absolved the People of this CoR obligation. Consequently, all the time from February 20 to April 9, 2018 should have been charged, not just the 7 days the People requested. Therefore, an additional 41 days (not including the 7 days already accounted for in the court's total) must be added to the People's chargeable time, which results in the People being charged with a total of 125 days (84 + 41). As there were more than 90 chargeable days in this case, dismissal of the accusatory instrument is mandated. Defendant's other appellate contentions are rendered academic, and we decline to address them. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"16\" id=\"pa16\"> Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is reversed and, upon reargument, defendant's motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on statutory speedy trial grounds is granted. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"17\" id=\"pa17\"> WESTON, J.P., and TOUSSAINT, J., concur. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"18\" id=\"pa18\"> GOLIA, J., dissents and votes to affirm the judgment of conviction in the following memorandum: <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"19\" id=\"pa19\"> After having previously announced their readiness, the People declared in court on January 12, 2018 that they were not ready to proceed to trial and requested a one-week adjournment to January 19th. The Criminal Court (Toni M. Cimino, J.), explaining that \"the People answered not ready on the last occasion and also requested a very short adjournment,\" upon granting the People's request for an adjournment, stated that the statutory speedy trial clock would run until the People filed a Certificate of Readiness (CoR) to stop it. On the next appearance date, February 20, 2018, the People, who had not filed a CoR in the interim, again announced their nonreadiness to proceed and requested a one-week adjournment. The court (Jerry M. Iannece, J.) adjourned the matter to April 11, 2018 but directed the People \"to be ready [for trial] on this one. You have to be ready.... You are not ready today. Next time I will charge you with all time until you are ready\" (emphasis added). On April 9, 2018, defendant made his initial speedy trial motion which was denied by the court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) by order dated May 24, 2018. The court charged the People with a total of 84 days, which included the entirety of the January 12-February 20, 2018 adjournment period (39 days) and only the 7 days requested by the People for the time period between February 20 and the April 9, 2018 motion. Upon reargument, the May 24, 2018 determination was adhered to by order (Toni M. Cimino, J.) dated October 11, 2018. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"20\" id=\"pa20\"> Defendant first argues, in effect, that the court's January 12, 2018 order directing the People to file a CoR to stop the speedy trial clock was the law of the case and therefore governed the February 20-April 9, 2018 period. Defendant submits that, since the People had not filed a CoR, the court improvidently exercised its discretion by charging only seven days of this adjournment period instead of enforcing its own order by charging the entirety thereof against the People, which extra days cause the People to exceed their statutory speedy trial time. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"21\" id=\"pa21\"> Generally \"law of the case does not apply when a court alters its own ruling, as opposed to the ruling of another court of coordinate jurisdiction\" (<i>Commercial Tenant Servs., Inc. v Northern Leasing Sys., Inc.<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/commercial-tenant-servs-inc-v-n-leasing-sys-inc#p897\" class=\"raw-ref\">131 A.D.3d 895, 897<\/a> [2015] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Consequently, it was not an improvident exercise of discretion for Judge Cimino, who issued both the CoR requirement on January 12, 2018 and the October 11, 2018 order adhering to her prior order denying defendant's statutory speedy trial motion, to decline to enforce her own CoR ruling and instead charge only the seven-day adjournment that the People requested on February 20, 2018. Indeed, Judge Cimino's decision denying defendant's speedy trial motion was appropriate because, as Judge Cimino found, \"the People may have reasonably relied upon\" Judge Iannece's February 20, 2018 statement. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"22\" id=\"pa22\"> Contrary to defendant's other statutory speedy trial argument, the People's explanation that they were not ready to proceed to trial at the January 12 and February 20, 2018 court appearances because they were attempting to procure surveillance camera footage did not, without more, render their previous statements of readiness per se illusory. \"There is nothing in <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 30.30<\/a> to preclude the People from declaring their present readiness, but still gathering additional evidence to strengthen their case....

The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree, and imposed sentence. The appeal brings up for review so much of an order of that court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) dated October 11, 2018 as, upon reargument, adhered to a prior determination of that court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) in an order dated May 24, 2018 denying defendant's motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on statutory speedy trial grounds. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\"> ORDERED that the judgment of conviction is reversed, on the law, and, upon reargument, defendant's motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on statutory speedy trial grounds is granted. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\"> Defendant was charged with petit larceny <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-penal\/part-3-specific-offenses\/title-j-offenses-involving-theft\/article-155-larceny\/section-15525-petit-larceny\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Penal Law \u00a7 155.25<\/a>) and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-penal\/part-3-specific-offenses\/title-j-offenses-involving-theft\/article-165-other-offenses-relating-to-theft\/section-16540-criminal-possession-of-stolen-property-in-the-fifth-degree\" class=\"raw-ref\">(Penal Law \u00a7 165.40<\/a>), and, after a jury trial, defendant was convicted of both counts and sentence was imposed. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\"> On appeal, defendant contests, among other things, an order of the Criminal Court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) dated October 11, 2018, which, upon reargument, adhered to that court's May 24, 2018 order (Toni M. Cimino, J.) denying defendant's April 9, 2018 motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on statutory speedy trial grounds, finding that only 84 days were chargeable to the People, which is less than the 90 days allotted to them in this matter (<i>see<\/i> <a href=\"\/statute\/consolidated-laws-of-new-york\/chapter-criminal-procedure\/part-1-general-provisions\/title-c-general-principles-relating-to-requirements-for-and-exemptions-from-criminal-prosecution\/article-30-timeliness-of-prosecutions-and-speedy-trial\/section-3030-speedy-trial-time-limitations\" class=\"raw-ref\">CPL 30.30<\/a> [1] [b]). Of particular relevance here is the period from January 12, 2018 through April 9, 2018. On January 12, 2018, the People answered not ready for trial. The Criminal Court (Toni M. Cimino, J.) adjourned the trial to February 20, 2018 and required the People, who had previously declared readiness, to file and serve a certificate of readiness (CoR) in order to stop the statutory speedy trial clock. On February 20, 2018, the prosecutor answered not ready and requested a one-week adjournment. The trial was adjourned to April 11, 2018, and the court (Jerry M. Iannece, J.) told the prosecutor that, if the People were not ready on that date, \"I will charge you with all time until you are ready.\" The April 11 trial date was adjourned because defendant filed his initial speedy trial motion on April 9, 2018.

Steve Delmar Enterprises Co., Inc., Respondent.<\/p> <\/section><hr> <section class=\"decision opinion\"> <p class=\"byline\">IANNACCI, J.P. TOLBERT and GARGUILO, JJ.<\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"5\" id=\"pa5\"> PRESENT: : <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"6\" id=\"pa6\">Appeal from a judgment of the District Court of Suffolk County, Second District (Carl J. Copertino, J.), entered July 14, 2014. The judgment, after a nonjury trial, awarded plaintiff the principal sum of $1,675. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"7\" id=\"pa7\">ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed, without costs. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"8\" id=\"pa8\">At plaintiff's request, Albergo Delmar, a decorating company, ordered wallpaper for installation in plaintiff's home. After a dispute arose over Albergo Delmar's responsibility to plaintiff with respect to 14 rolls of wallpaper that had been left unused when the project had been completed, Steve Delmar, the husband of Albergo Delmar's principal, picked up the excess rolls from plaintiff, informed plaintiff that the wallpaper distributor would reimburse 65% of the cost of the wallpaper, and handed plaintiff a business card from his company, Steve Delmar Enterprises Co., Inc. Plaintiff commenced this small claims action against Steve Delmar Enterprises Co., Inc. to recover the value of the excess wallpaper. It is undisputed that plaintiff has not received any refund for the wallpaper and that the wallpaper was not returned to her prior to the commencement of this action. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"9\" id=\"pa9\">On July 14, 2014, after a nonjury trial, the District Court issued a decision stating that plaintiff was awarded judgment in the amount of $1,675 and that defendant could avoid paying \"the judgment\" if it returned the wallpaper to plaintiff in new condition within 10 days of receipt of the court's decision. A judgment awarding plaintiff the principal sum of $1,675 was entered which, however, does not contain the condition set forth in the decision. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"10\" id=\"pa10\">In their briefs, both parties represent that, following the District Court's decision, defendant attempted to return the wallpaper to plaintiff. However, plaintiff contends that the wallpaper was not in new condition, while defendant argues that plaintiff cannot make that representation because she refused the delivery without opening the boxes. As these facts are dehors the record, they cannot be considered on this appeal (<i>see Chimarios v Duhl<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/chimarios-v-duhl\" class=\"raw-ref\">152 AD2d 508<\/a> [1989]). In any event, the issue of defendant's alleged compliance with the court's decision is irrelevant to the determination of this appeal, since the judgment being appealed unconditionally awards plaintiff the principal sum of $1,675. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"11\" id=\"pa11\">Plaintiff's only other argument on appeal is that the court's decision included a factual mistake. However, plaintiff has not asked this court to modify the judgment so as to award her <span page-number=\"2\" pagination-id=\"No. 2015-414 S C\" id=\"p2\"><\/span> any greater amount than is reflected in the judgment from which she appeals, and, in any event, the alleged mistake affords no basis to grant such relief. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"12\" id=\"pa12\">We do not consider defendant's contention on appeal that the District Court erred in failing to dismiss the action against it, as defendant did not cross-appeal from the judgment (<i>see Hecht v City of New York<\/i>, <a href=\"\/case\/hecht-v-city-of-new-york-3#p61\" class=\"raw-ref\">60 NY2d 57, 61<\/a> [1983]; <i>Shaheen v Webster Realty Assoc<\/i>., <a href=\"\/case\/shaheen-v-webster-realty-associates\" class=\"raw-ref\">16 AD3d 663<\/a> [2005]). <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"13\" id=\"pa13\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We note that defendant may, if it be so advised, move in the District Court to vacate the judgment on the basis of its alleged compliance with the condition of the decision. <\/p> <p class=\"paragraph\" pa-id=\"14\" id=\"pa14\">Iannacci, J.P., Tolbert and Garguilo, JJ., concur.
