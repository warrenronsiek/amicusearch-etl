Blair for the defendants:","syllabus":"<p>On the 2ith June, 1865, restrictions on commercial intercourse between Neio Orleans and places on the roest bank of tlie Mississippi are removed by the President’s proclamation of that date. On the same day the Treasury agent in New Orleans, being ignorant of the issuing of the proclamation, exacts from the owner of cotton brought in from the west bank the one-fourth of the value thereof required by the Act 2d July, 1864, and the Treasury Regulations 9th May, 1865. The owner, likewise ignorant of the proclamation, pays the amount, executes the necessary papers, and receives the cotton. By the terms of the transaction the eotton is delivered to him freed from the payment of all fees and internal-revenue taxes. The claimant noto brings his action to recover back the moneys thus paid.</p> <p>I. It must be held from the nature of the decision that the Supreme Court intended to decide in La' Peyre’s Case (8 C. Cls. R., p. 165) that the claimant had primarily a good cause of action, i. e., that his payment of a bonus or fee to a Treasury agent for a license to bring cotton into New Orleans in June, 1865, under the non-intercourse acts was not a voluntary payment made in ignorance of law, all restrictions having then been abrogated by the President’s Proclamation 24i7i June, 1865, but the owner and agent being ignorant of the existence of the proclamation.</p> <p>II. A voluntary payment made in mutual mistake of law cannot be recovered back; but where a man’s goods are in the possession of an officer who has no authority to retain them, yet exacts the payment of a fee as a condition to restoring them, the payment, in contemplation of law, is not voluntary, though both parties believe it to be legal, in fact acting in ignorance of law.</p> <p>III. The fact that cotton was restored to the owner freed from all “fees ” and “taxes,” does not preclude him from recovering back a bonus or license-fee illegally exacted by the Treasury agents in New Orleans in June, 1865, and by them paid into the Treasury. If the Government lost a tax by the transaction which it was entitled to receive, the right may be asserted by set-off.</p> <p>IV. No action can be maintained to recover back the bonus or license-tee exacted as a condition to commercial intercourse under the Aot Sit July, 1864, (13 Stat.
