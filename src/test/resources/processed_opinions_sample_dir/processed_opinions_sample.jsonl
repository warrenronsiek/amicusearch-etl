Rayford L. TERRELL, Defendant-Appellant. No. 08-10560. United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. Argued and Submitted December 7, 2009. Filed February 2, 2010. *1086 Daniel R. Drake, Drake Law, PLC, Phoenix, AZ, for the defendant-appellant. Karla Hotis Delord, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Phoenix, AZ, for the plaintiff-appellee. Before A. WALLACE TASHIMA, SUSAN P. GRABER and JAY S. BYBEE, Circuit Judges. BYBEE, Circuit Judge: Defendant-Appellant Rayford L. Terrell was convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The district court enhanced Terrell's sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. §§ 921-31, which raises the mandatory minimum sentence for convicted felons in possession of a firearm who have \"three previous convictions ... for a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Terrell argues that the prior convictions relied upon for the enhancementsexual assault under Arizona law, second-degree burglary under Arizona law, and second-degree burglary under Missouri lawdo not qualify as \"violent felon[ies]\" under the ACCA. We hold that all of these prior offenses fit categorically within the ACCA's residual clause in that they \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Id. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, we affirm the district court's decision to enhance Terrell's sentence. I On May 31, 2005, as part of a large-scale operation to identify drug and firearm dealers, Phoenix Police Detective Matthew Shay met with Terrell, claiming that he wanted to purchase firearms. After several subsequent discussions and meetings with Terrell and with Terrell's co-defendant, Cindy O'Quinn, Shay purchased a.380 caliber pistol from Terrell. On September 20, 2006, Terrell was charged in the District of Arizona with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The indictment also alleged that, at the time of the offense, Terrell had previously been convicted of at least three felony offenses: (1) Burglary in the Second Degree on or about November 23, 1988, in Maricopa County, Arizona; (2) Sexual Assault on or about September 8, 1992, in Maricopa County, Arizona; and (3) Burglary in the Second Degree on or about March 3, 1993, in St. Louis County, Missouri. Following a two-day trial, the jury found Terrell guilty as charged. *1087 The Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") found that Terrell had \"committed the instant offense subsequent to sustaining three felony convictions for crimes of violence, as defined in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a).\" According to the PSR, these prior convictions made Terrell \"an Armed Career Criminal within the meaning of U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4 and[therefore] subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e),\" the ACCA.[1] These determinations resulted in an offense level of thirty-three. The PSR then found that Terrell's offense level of thirty-three and criminal history category of VI resulted in a Sentencing Guidelines range of 235 to 293 months. Terrell objected to the PSR, arguing that the alleged prior felony convictions were not \"violent felon[ies]\" and therefore that Terrell was not subject to an enhanced sentence under the ACCA. The district court overruled Terrell's objections to the PSR and held that Terrell's prior convictions qualified him as an armed career criminal under the ACCA. The court stated: I think ... the whole approach to the categorization of prior offenses as crimes of violence ... is really needlessly complex.... And the case law that has developed ... contributes, I think, to the wholesale confusion in this area.... We, I think, intuitively know what Congress is trying to do, and yet given all the gloss and all the complexity, its intent is sometimes frustrated.... [I]t strikes me that at the end of the day, whether [Terrell's prior offenses] fit nicely within the categorical approach or the modified categorical approach, that, at a minimum, they fit within the residual clause of [the ACCA] as violent felonies. However, the court granted the government's motion for a downward departure of two levels for substantial assistance and sentenced Terrell at the low end of the post-departure Guidelines range: 188 months' imprisonment, followed by a five-year term of supervised release. Terrell timely appealed. II Terrell argues that the district court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence under the ACCA, contending that his prior felony convictions do not qualify as \"violent felon[ies].\"[2] \"We review de novo whether a prior conviction is a predicate felony under the ACCA.\" United States v. Grisel, 488 F.3d 844, 846 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). We first review the complex statutory and legal framework governing this case. *1088 Terrell was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), which prohibits previously convicted felons from possessing firearms. In the ordinary case, the maximum penalty for violating § 922(g) is a fine and imprisonment for up to ten years. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2). However, a defendant convicted of violating § 922(g) who \"has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony\" is subject to a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence. Id. § 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another[.] Id. § 924(e)(2)(B). The government has conceded that none of Terrell's prior convictions fits within the first provision of the \"violent felony\" definitionthose felonies that \"ha[ve] as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Thus, for each of Terrell's prior convictions, we must apply the categorical and, if appropriate, modified categorical approach to determine whether the state offense fits within one of two portions of § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (\"subsection (ii)\"). See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990). First, we must determine whether the prior felony fits within the enumerated offenses in subsection (ii): burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes that involve the use of explosives. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). If not, we must determine, second, whether the prior felony fits within subsection (ii)'s residual clause, in that it \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Id. Our analysis of whether Terrell's prior convictions fit within the residual clause contains a unique element because of the Supreme Court's decision in Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 128 S. Ct. 1581, 170 L. Ed. 2d 490 (2008). In Begay, the Supreme Court determined that subsection (ii)'s enumerated offensesburglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives\"indicate[ ] that the statute covers only similar crimes, rather than every crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" Id. at 1585 (internal quotation marks omitted). In order to give effect to all of the words in subsection (ii), the Court held that the enumerated offenses \"limit[ ] the crimes that clause (ii) covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves.\" Id. The Court noted further that the enumerated crimes \"all typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\" Id. at 1586 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, even if Terrell's offenses \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), we must determine whether these crimes are \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offensesthat is, whether they \"typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted). III We now address, in turn, whether Terrell's sexual assault and burglary convictions fit within the ACCA's \"violent felony\" definition. *1089 A Arizona law provides that \"[a] person commits sexual assault by intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact with any person without consent of such person.\" ARIZ. REV. STAT. § 13-1406(A) (emphasis added). The statute defines \"without consent\" to include circumstances in which \"[t]he victim is coerced by the immediate use or threatened use of force against a person or property.\" Id. § 13-1401(5)(a). However, it also includes circumstances in which no force or threat of force is used, including where \"[t]he victim is incapable of consent\" because of mental disorder, drugs, or other similar impairments known to the defendant, id. § 13-1401(5)(b); where \"[t]he victim is intentionally deceived as to the nature of the act,\" id. § 13-1401(5)(c); or where \"[t]he victim is intentionally deceived to erroneously believe that the person is the victim's spouse,\" id. § 13-1401(5)(d). Sexual assault is not one of the enumerated offenses in subsection (ii). Thus, we must decide whether Terrell's sexual assault offense fits within the residual clause. This determination requires us to determine: (1) whether the offense \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); and (2) whether sexual assault under Arizona law is \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that it \"typically involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted). 1 Regarding the categorical approach, Terrell argues that, because the Arizona sexual assault statute does not require force or coercion, but rather a person can be convicted of sexual assault even if the victim permits the intercourse, his prior sexual assault offense does not fit categorically within the residual clause. This argument is foreclosed by our decision in United States v. Riley, 183 F.3d 1155 (9th Cir.1999). In Riley, we held that a conviction for \"attempted simple rape\" under Louisiana law qualified categorically as a \"crime of violence\" in that it involved conduct that presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Id. at 1159. Like the Arizona sexual assault statute, the Louisiana simple rape statute included circumstances in which no coercion or force was used, such as when the victim did not understand the nature of the act by reason of drugs or \"unsoundness of mind,\" or when the victim submitted to the intercourse based on the belief that the defendant was her husband. See id. at 1158. We reasoned that the personal contact inherently involved in simple rape \"coupled with the nature of this offense creates an atmosphere that fosters the potential for physical confrontation,\" so that \"[e]ven in its least violent form, simple rape ... could result in physical injury to the victim.\" Id. at 1159. In this sense, Terrell's case is indistinguishable from Riley, and thus he argues only that Riley is no longer good law in light of Begay. It is true that Riley (which was decided before Begay) did not consider whether the Louisiana simple rape offense was \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses, and thus left open the question whether the Arizona sexual assault statute satisfies the Begay analysis. However, Begay does not affect the Riley court's determination that simple rape (a similar offense to sexual assault under Arizona law) involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another even if it can be committed with the permission of the victim. Whether the *1090 Arizona statute satisfies Begay's \"roughly similar\" test is an issue separate from the issue whether the statute involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. See Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1585 (stating that the presence of the enumerated offenses \"indicates that the statute covers only similar crimes, rather than every crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We turn now to the Begay analysis. 2 We have not decided the issue framed by Begay: whether sexual assault \"typically involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\" Id. at 1586 (internal quotation marks omitted). Terrell argues that sexual assault under Arizona law does not satisfy this test because a defendant can be convicted under the Arizona statute even if the intercourse occurs with the victim's permission, such as when the defendant deceives the victim into thinking that the defendant is the victim's spouse. He relies primarily on our decision in United States v. Christensen, 559 F.3d 1092 (9th Cir.2009). In Christensen, we held that the defendant's conviction for statutory rape under Washington law did not constitute a \"violent felony\" under Begay. Christensen, 559 F.3d at 1095. Under Washington law, a person could be guilty of statutory rape simply by having sexual intercourse with a person of a certain age, regardless of whether the victim consented to the intercourse. See id. at 1093. We first noted that, \"[b]ecause the Court in Begay used the conjunction `and,' all three of its criteria'purposeful, violent, and aggressive' must be satisfied.\" Id. at 1095. We then held that, \"because statutory rape may involve consensual sexual intercourse, it does not necessarily involve either `violent' or `aggressive' conduct.\" Id. (citation omitted). Terrell's case is distinguishable from Christensen in three crucial ways. First, whereas the \"typical\" case of statutory rape does not involve violent and aggressive conduct, the \"typical\" case of ordinary sexual assault does indeed involve violent and aggressive conduct. Pure statutory rape laws like the law in Christensen are generally designed to target precisely the kind of situation that does not involve violent or aggressive conduct. Their purpose is instead to target defendants whose sexual partners are, by law, considered too young to give lawful consent. In contrast, simple rape is \"a violent crime because it normally involves force, or the threat of force or intimidation, to overcome the will and the capacity of the victim to resist. Rape is very often accompanied by physical injury to the female and can also inflict mental and psychological damage.\" Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 597-98, 97 S. Ct. 2861, 53 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1977) (emphases added). It is true that some sexual assault statutes, like the Arizona statute, have been drawn in such a way as to sweep in some cases that do not necessarily involve violence or aggression, such as when the defendant deceives the victim. However, this extra coverage does not change the fact that the \"typical\" case of sexual assault does involve violent and aggressive actions by the defendant. See id. Second, even in those cases where the rape is \"achieved by trickery or deception,\" that fact \"does not erase the everpresent possibility that the victim may figure out what's really going on and decide to resist, in turn requiring the perpetrator to resort to actual physical restraint\" that could then \"easily escalate into a violent confrontation.\" Riley, 183 F.3d at 1159 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis *1091 added). In this sense, the ordinary case of sexual assault involves at least as much violence and aggression as the ordinary case of burglary. Generic burglary, after all, is often accomplished in cases where no one other than the defendant is present in the structure being burglarized, and thus a violent confrontation will occur only if someone arrives and discovers the defendant. In contrast, \"[p]ersonal contact is, of course, part and parcel of simple rape,\" id. at 1158, making the potential for face-to-face physical confrontation more likely in \"deceptive\" sexual assault cases than in the ordinary case of burglary. On the other hand, the typical case of statutory rape does not involve this same risk of violent escalation. Ordinarily, there is nothing that the victim is likely to \"figure out,\" id. at 1159, during the sexual activity that would cause the situation to escalate into violence. Thus, sexual assault under Arizona law is very different from the statute in Christensen despite the fact that both statutes punish certain kinds of sexual activity. Third, the Christensen court relied explicitly on the fact that \"statutory rape may involve consensual sexual intercourse\" in finding that it did \"not necessarily involve either `violent' or `aggressive' conduct.\" 559 F.3d at 1095 (emphasis added). The Arizona sexual assault statute explicitly requires that the defendant engage in sexual activity \"without consent\" of the victim. ARIZ. REV. STAT. § 13-1406(A) (emphasis added). Although Arizona law defines \"without consent\" to include certain circumstances where no force or coercion is used, see id. § 13-1401(5)(b)-(d), a lack of consent on the part of the victim is an express element of Arizona sexual assault, which was not the case in Christensen. \"Short of homicide, [rape] is the ultimate violation of self,\" Coker, 433 U.S. at 597, 97 S. Ct. 2861 (internal quotation marks omitted), and apart from homicide it is hard to imagine any crime that has a greater tendency to \"involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1586. Thus, we hold that Terrell's prior sexual assault conviction qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA's residual clause because it \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and is \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that it typically \"involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1586. B We turn now to Terrell's burglary convictions. Terrell was convicted of second-degree burglary under both Arizona and Missouri law. Arizona law provides that \"[a] person commits burglary in the second degree by entering or remaining unlawfully in or on a residential structure with the intent to commit any theft or any felony therein.\" ARIZ. REV. STAT. § 13-1507(A) (emphasis added). Importantly, a separate provision defines the term \"residential structure\" to mean \"any structure, movable or immovable, permanent or temporary, that is adapted for both human residence and lodging whether occupied or not.\" Id. § 13-1501(11) (emphasis added). Finally, the statute defines \"structure\" to include \"any vending machine or any building, object, vehicle, railroad car or place with sides and a floor that is separately securable from any other structure attached to it.\" Id. § 13-1501(12). Similarly, Missouri law provides that \"[a] person commits the crime of burglary in the second degree when he knowingly enters unlawfully or knowingly remains unlawfully in a building or inhabitable structure for the purpose of committing a *1092 crime therein.\" MO. REV. STAT. § 569.170(1) (emphasis added). Missouri Revised Statute section 569.010(2), in turn, also includes movable objects in the burglary definition, providing that the term \"inhabitable structure\" includes \"a ship, trailer, sleeping car, airplane, or other vehicle or structure\" where people live, conduct business, assemble, or stay overnight. We now address, in turn, whether these state burglary offenses fit within either the enumerated offenses or residual clause of subsection (ii) of the ACCA's \"violent felony\" definition. We hold that, although Terrell's prior burglary offenses do not fit within the enumerated offenses, they do fit within the residual clause. 1 Burglary is one of the enumerated offenses in subsection (ii) of the ACCA. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). In determining whether Terrell's prior burglary offenses fit within the burglary offense enumerated in the ACCA, we must apply the categorical and modified categorical approaches to compare Terrell's prior burglary offenses to the \"generic\" definition of burglary set forth in Taylor, which contains three elements: \"[1] unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, [2] a building or structure, [3] with intent to commit a crime.\" 495 U.S. at 599, 110 S. Ct. 2143. Because the government has conceded that Terrell's burglary convictions do not fit categorically within the generic burglary definition, our inquiry is whether, under the modified categorical approach, judicially recognized documents show that Terrell was necessarily convicted of generic burglary. See Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 15-16, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (2005). With respect to Terrell's Arizona burglary conviction, the prosecution submitted an indictment, plea agreement, and judgment to the district court. The indictment alleges that Terrell, \"on or about the 7th day of October, 1986, with intent to commit a theft or a felony therein, entered or remained unlawfully in or on the residential structure of L_______ M_________, located at 2__________ N. 13th St.\"[3] This indictment simply uses the same \"residential structure\" wording as the Arizona burglary statute, which includes both movable and unmovable structures. See ARIZ. REV. STAT. § 13-1501(11). It does not indicate whether the structure was \"intended for use in one place\" as opposed to movable, as is required by the generic burglary definition. Grisel, 488 F.3d at 848. The indictment also does not indicate whether or not the \"intent to commit the crime was formed after entering the structure and/or the entry was privileged.\" United States v. Bonat, 106 F.3d 1472, 1475 (9th Cir. 1997) (noting that \"Arizona courts have expanded the statute beyond generic burglary [by interpreting] the statute to allow a conviction even if the intent to commit the crime was formed after entering the structure and/or the entry was privileged\"). The plea agreement and judgment are even less informative. The plea agreement simply refers to the offense as \"Count III: Burglary in the Second Degree, A Class 3 Felony,\" while the judgment refers to the offense as \"Count III  Burglary 2nd Degree committed while on probation.\" Regarding Terrell's Missouri burglary convictions, the prosecution provided copies of the charging documents, plea agreements, and judgment. None of those documents provides any indication of whether Terrell entered an unmovable structure as *1093 opposed to a ship, airplane, or other movable structure. See MO. REV. STAT. § 569.010(2) (including in its \"burglary\" definition \"ship[s], trailer[s], sleeping car[s], airplane[s], [and] other vehicle[s] or structure[s]\"). One charging document stated that Terrell \"knowingly entered unlawfully[an] inhabitable structure, located at 8_______ Cranberry Lane, and possessed by G________ L___________, for the purpose of committing stealing therein.\" Another stated essentially the same thing except for a different address and owner. The plea agreements and judgment simply referred to Terrell's offenses as burglary in the second degree, a Class C felony. In sum, the documents submitted by the prosecution do not demonstrate that Terrell was necessarily convicted of burglary of an unmovable structure, so under the modified categorical approach, Terrell's prior offenses do not fit within the ACCA's enumerated offenses. 2 We turn now to the residual clause. To determine whether Terrell's burglary convictions fit within subsection (ii)'s residual clause, we must answer two questions: (1) whether the prior offenses \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); and (2) if the first question is answered in the affirmative, whether Terrell's prior offenses are \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that they \"typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\" Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has emphasized that the categorical approach does not \"requir[e] that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony.\" James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 208, 127 S. Ct. 1586, 167 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2007). \"Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\" Id. In light of these considerations, the Arizona and Missouri burglary offenses fit easily within the ACCA's residual clause. Terrell argues that, because the state statutes may be violated by \"entering a temporary, unoccupied structure,\" these offenses involve a lower risk of injury than generic burglary. And regarding the Arizona statute in particular, Terrell argues that, because the statute \"lacks the element of criminal intent formed prior to entry, it does not embody the same risks as the generic burglary.\" Neither of these arguments is persuasive, because the Supreme Court and this court have consistently held that burglary involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, even in cases where the relevant state statutes were missing the same elements of generic burglary that are missing from the Arizona and Missouri burglary statutes in this case. In James, the Supreme Court held that Florida's attempted burglary offense fit within subsection (ii)'s residual clause even though the offense did not even require entry into a structure, let alone the \"unlawful\" entry required by Taylor. See James, 550 U.S. at 195, 197, 127 S. Ct. 1586. The Court emphasized that \"[t]he main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another's property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party.\" Id. at 203, 127 S. Ct. 1586. Similarly, the lack of a requirement of unlawful intent prior to entry in Arizona *1094 burglary law does not change the fact that committing the offense, \"in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\" Id. at 208, 127 S. Ct. 1586. As for the lack of an \"unmovable structure\" requirement, the argument that this omission precludes a burglary offense from fitting categorically within the residual clause is foreclosed in by our decision in United States v. Mayer, 560 F.3d 948 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 130 S. Ct. 158, 175 L. Ed. 2d 100 (2009). In Mayer, we held that first-degree burglary in Oregon was categorically a violent felony under the residual clause even though Oregon's definition of \"building\" included vehicles, aircrafts, and other movable structures, and was thus broader than Taylor's generic definition. See id. at 954, 959. We relied on James to find that \"[t]he risk of potential injury due to a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party is not lessened simply because, under Oregon law, the dwelling does not have to be a generic `building' or `structure.'\" Id. at 963. Similarly, committing burglary under Arizona or Missouri law presents a serious potential risk of physical injury despite the statutes' broad definitions of \"structure.\" See United States v. Cantrell, 530 F.3d 684, 695-96 (8th Cir.2008) (holding that Missouri's second-degree burglary offense was categorically a \"crime of violence\" under the residual clause of the Guidelines' definition despite its broad definition of \"inhabitable structure,\" because of \"the risk of a violent confrontation between [the defendant] and the occupant, the police, or another third party\"). Having decided that Terrell's burglary offenses fit categorically within subsection (ii)'s residual clause, we must determine whether these offenses are \"roughly similar\" to the enumerated offenses in that they \"typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\" Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have little difficulty concluding that they are. Simply put, it is hard to imagine that a state's \"burglary\" definition would not be at least \"roughly similar\" to generic \"burglary.\" Terrell argues, however, that \"it is not enough to look at the label of the offense.\" He argues that, because the state burglary definitions include movable structures, the crimes of which Terrell was convicted are not \"similar, in kind as well as in degree of risks posed, to the examples themselves.\" Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1585. He also contends that, because \"a lawful entry into a building poses a lesser risk than forced entry,\" the Arizona statute's lack of a requirement of criminal intent formed prior to entry means that Arizona burglary \"does not necessarily involve violent, aggressive behavior.\" There are two problems with Terrell's argument. First, it conflicts with James and Mayer. In Mayer, we held that Oregon's first-degree burglary statute satisfied the Begay test despite its inclusion of movable \"buildings,\" reasoning that a burglar's entry into movable buildings \"typically involves, much like generic burglary,... `purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.'\" Mayer, 560 F.3d at 962 (quoting Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1586). And with respect to the Arizona statute's lack of a requirement of criminal intent formed prior to entry, James (although decided before Begay) conducted a similar analysis to the Begay test in finding that \"the risk posed by attempted burglary is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenseshere, completed burglary.\" James, 550 U.S. at 203, 127 S. Ct. 1586 (emphasis added). The Court found that, even though Florida's attempted burglary offense did not require *1095 any entry into a structure, it posed the same kinds of risks as generic burglary because of the dangerous \"possibility of a face-to-face confrontation\" with a third party involved in any burglary. Id. Given that the Arizona law does not require \"unlawful entry\" but still requires \"entry,\" making it even more like generic burglary than the statute in James, we reject Terrell's argument that the Arizona statute is not \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary. The second problem with Terrell's argument is that it essentially converts the Begay analysis into a restatement of the question whether the offense of conviction fits categorically within subsection (ii)'s enumerated offenses. Given our determinations thus far, Terrell's Begay argument would result in the following three-step analysis: (1) Terrell's burglary offenses do not fit categorically within the enumerated offenses; (2) Terrell's burglary offenses fit categorically within subsection (ii)'s residual clausethat is, in the ordinary case, burglary presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another; (3) under Begay, Terrell's burglary offenses are not \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary because they cover a broader range of conduct than the enumerated burglary offense. Under this logic, the Begay analysis (step 3) is not meaningfully different from the determination of whether the burglary convictions fit categorically within the enumerated offenses (step 1), a result that renders the residual clause (and step 2) meaningless. The more plausible interpretation of Begay is that a state burglary offense is almost always at least \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary even if the state offense is somewhat broader.[4] Thus, we hold that Terrell's Arizona and Missouri burglary convictions qualify as \"violent felon[ies]\" under the residual clause because they \"involve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and are \"roughly similar\" to generic burglary, Begay, 128 S.Ct. at 1585. IV Because the district court correctly held that Terrell had been convicted of at least three \"violent felon[ies]\" at the time he committed his felon in possession offense, we affirm the district court's decision to enhance Terrell's sentence under the ACCA. AFFIRMED. NOTES [1] The definition of \"violent felony\" under the ACCA is nearly identical to the definition of \"crime of violence\" under § 4B1.2 of the Guidelines, so we have interpreted these provisions in a \"parallel manner.\" United States v. Jennings, 515 F.3d 980, 990 n. 11 (9th Cir.2008). In order to avoid confusion, we will discuss Terrell's convictions in terms of the ACCA, but the analysis applies equally to § 4B1.2. [2] Terrell also argues that the enhancement of his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment because the prosecution did not prove his prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He argues that the Supreme Court's rule announced in Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S. Ct. 1219, 140 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1998), namely that prior convictions need not be proved to a jury, see id. at 247, 118 S. Ct. 1219, has been called into question by the Court's subsequent decisions in Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1999), and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000). However, Terrell acknowledges that this position is contrary to Ninth Circuit law. See United States v. Grisel, 488 F.3d 844, 846 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). He raises the issue only so as not to forfeit it. [3] We have redacted the names and addresses of Terrell's victims. [4] However, we do not hold that a state burglary offense can never fail Begay's \"roughly similar\" test.","citations":["596 F.3d 38"],"ltree":["federal_supreme","federal_supreme/federal_appeal_11","federal_supreme/federal_appeal_11/federal_district_fl_sd"],"generated_summary":"stub","outbound_citations":["42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983"]}

FINDINGS OF FACT Some of the facts have been stipulated. The stipulations, together with the exhibits *172 attached thereto, are incorporated herein by this reference. Petitioner is an Ohio corporation having its principal office in Cincinnati, Ohio, at the time it filed its petition herein. Its Federal income tax returns for the years 1958 to 1962, inclusive, were filed with the district director of internal revenue, Cincinnati, Ohio. Petitioner is a mutual life insurance company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Ohio. Its operations and accounts are subject to the supervision and approval of the superintendent of insurance for the State of Ohio and, because it does business in numerous States, it is subject to periodic audit of its accounts by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which acts on behalf of the insurance departments of the various States. The tax returns filed in the years here involved were prepared on the same basis as was used on the annual statement required of life insurance companies by the NAIC, with some adjustments. In life insurance, premiums are the agreed price for assuming and carrying the risk. Gross premium is the amount actually charged the insured and is composed of the net valuation premium and \"loading.\" The*173 net valuation premium on a particular policy is that amount of money which, using the mortality table and interest rate assumed for the policy, will be exactly sufficient to provide the benefits of the policy and is required by State law to be added to the policy reserve each year. \"Loading\" refers to an amount added to the net valuation premium for estimated administration, management, and operating expenses, contingencies, profits in the case of capital stock companies, and dividends in the case of mutual companies. The amount of \"loading\" results from an independent judgment of each particular company and may vary from company to company. Policyholders may pay premiums in semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly installments. An additional amount is added when an installment method of paying the premium is elected. *1038 \"Deferred and uncollected premiums\" are the premiums on policies with premiums payable more often than annually which become due after December 31 of the calendar year and before the next policy anniversary date. \"Due and unpaid premiums\" are premiums which are due to be paid before the end of the year, but which have not been paid by December 31. As*174 required by law, all policies provide for a 31-day grace period for the payment of premiums after their due date, during which period the policy is carried in full force and effect. \"Deferred and uncollected premiums\" and \"due and unpaid premiums\" are hereinafter sometimes referred to as due and deferred premiums. 2 There is no obligation, legal or otherwise, on an insured to pay to the insurer due and deferred premiums. If the policyholder does not pay the premium in conformity with the provisions of the policy, the policy is lapsed after the grace period and appropriate adjustments are made. Petitioner was required by the State of Ohio and by the NAIC to compute its reserves on the great majority of its life insurance policies on the assumption that premiums were paid*175 up 1 year in advance on each anniversary date commencing with the issuance date of the policy, even though premiums were not usually paid in this manner. The reserves so computed were reflected as a liability of petitioner and, as required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959, 3 were taken into account in the computations required under sections 805 and 809 on the Federal income tax returns filed by petitioner for the taxable years 1958 to 1962, inclusive. The NAIC annual statement treats deferred and uncollected premiums on a net basis. Item 17, on the assets page of the balance sheet, calls for the statement of \"Life insurance premiums and annuity considerations deferred and uncollected\" on a net premium basis. Exhibit 13 of the annual statement, which gives the detail of the assets, sets forth deferred and uncollected*176 premiums on a net basis. It provides for a memorandum account to show the amount of loading excluded from the deferred and uncollected premiums. Item 16 of the liabilities page of the balance sheet calls for a statement of the \"'Cost of collection' on premiums and annuity considerations deferred and uncollected in excess of total loading thereon.\" As required by the NAIC annual statement, petitioner's annual statements showed net *1039 premiums deferred and uncollected as an asset. Also in conformity with the form, petitioner's annual statement did not show loading as an asset. In the summary of operations contained in the NAIC annual statements, line 1.1, \"Premiums and annuity considerations,\" includes deferred and uncollected premiums on a gross basis. It (line 1.1) provides for the inclusion of such premiums at gross to be added to gross premiums collected during the year less deferred and uncollected premiums at gross as of the end of the previous year. Line 17, which is the \"Increase in aggregate reserve for policies and contracts with life contingencies,\" removes from income the net portion of the deferred and uncollected premiums. Line 25 provides for the deduction*177 of the increase in loading on deferred and uncollected premiums and also for the deduction of cost of collection of premiums in excess of loading on deferred and uncollected premiums. In determining net gain from operations, lines 8 through 26A of the Summary of Operations list various allowable deductions, including the deduction in line 25 for increase in loading on deferred and uncollected premiums. This deduction was claimed by petitioner on its Federal income tax returns in determining its net gain from operations. Exclusive of increases in loading, the petitioner deducted all expenses actually paid or incurred each year on its NAIC annual statements and Federal income tax returns. In its income tax returns for the years involved, petitioner did not include any due and deferred premiums as an asset, but it now concedes that they should be so included in an amount equal to the net valuation premiums. In these returns, petitioner did include, as an income item, an amount of due and deferred premiums equal to the deductions for increase in loading and increase in reserves. OPINION This case presents two issues relating to the interpretation and application of the Life Insurance*178 Company Income Tax Act of 1959. 26 U.S.C. sec. 801 et seq. The Act was a comprehensive revision of the prior schemes for taxing the incomes of life insurance companies. See H. Rept. No. 34, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1-8 (1959); S. Rept. No. 291, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1-12 (1959). Section 802(b) sets out a three-phase approach which is to be followed in computing a life insurance company's taxable income. 4 In *1040 arriving at taxable investment income and gain from operations, the 1959 Act recognizes that life insurance companies are legally obligated to keep policyholder reserves in order to meet future claims, that they normally add a significant portion of their investment income to these reserves, and that these annual reserve increments should not be subjected to tax. United States v. Atlas Ins. Co., 381 U.S. 233, 235-236 (1965). The Act thus attempts to tax only those portions of investment income and premium income which represent profit to the company, legally available for distribution to policyholders or stockholders as dividends, as distinguished from those gains which, under State*179 law, must be set aside to meet the company's future contractual obligations. Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Co. v. United States, 408 F. 2d 842, 844 (C.A. 4, 1969). We note at the outset that we do not approach this case with a tabula rasa. Three Courts of Appeals, as well as this Court on two occasions, have decided similar cases involving one or both of the issues involved herein. Franklin Life Insurance Co. v. United States, 399 F. 2d 757*180 (C.A. 7, 1968); Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Co. v. United States, supra;Western National Life Insurance Co. of Texas v. Commissioner, 432 F. 2d 298 (C.A. 5, 1970), reversing and remanding 50 T.C. 285 (1968) as modified by 51 T.C. 824 (1969). In view of the detailed analysis contained in the various opinions in these cases, we are relieved of the necessity of exposition beyond what is essential to the articulation of our position herein. The two issues requiring decision stem from certain propositions which are not in dispute: (1) That life insurance reserves are properly taken into account in computing the numerator of a fraction utilized in determining the amount to be eliminated from \"investment income,\" subject to the so-called phase I tax; (2) that the annual increase in such reserves is a proper deduction in determining gain from operations, which is subject to the so-called phase II tax; (3) that such reserves include a purported liability in an amount computed on the assumption that premiums are paid up 1 year in advance on each anniversary date commencing*181 with the issuance date of the policy; and (4) that, to the extent of such amount, a liability is recognized which does not reflect the normal requirements of accrual accounting. The first issue to be resolved is the extent to which due and deferred premiums should be taken into account in computing the amount of \"assets\" as defined in section 805(b)(4), 5 an amount which is in the *1041 denominator of a fraction whose numerator includes \"life insurance reserves.\" The fraction is a key element in determining the policyholders' share of investment income which is to be excluded from taxable investment income and consequently not subject to the so-called phase I tax. Obviously, the smaller the denominator, the larger the fraction and therefore the greater the amount to be excluded and the smaller the amount subject to tax. Respondent argues that the word \"assets\" should include the gross amount of due and deferred premiums. He bases his contention on the following syllogism: (1) Life insurance reserves are included in the numerator of the fraction; (2) those reserves include an amount attributable to due and deferred premiums computed, as previously indicated, on the assumption*182 that premiums are paid 1 year in advance; (3) such an assumption having furnished the underpinning for the computation of an element in the numerator of the fraction, the same assumption should control the determination of the denominator of the fraction. Or, to put it another way, respondent contends that, since the liability represented by life insurance reserves is based on the premise that the item giving rise to such liability has been received, the same premise must be utilized in computing the assets which are subject to such liability. *183 We think respondent's syllogism proves too much. Initially, we point out that the assumption upon which respondent relies so heavily has its roots in the procedures of the NAIC and presumably the requirements of State law with respect to the necessity of establishing reserves. There is no indication in the statute itself or the legislative history that such an assumption was the foundation for the statutory provision permitting the liability, represented by reserves allocated to due and deferred premiums, to be taken into account. See H. Rept. No. 34, supra; S. Rept. No. 291, supra; H. Rept. No. 520, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959); but see Franklin Life Insurance Co. v. United States, 399 F. 2d at 761. Only if we were to adopt an osmotic view of legislative intent could we say that the assumption in question was the foundation for legislative action and, even in such a circumstance, we would have to extend the process of osmosis from a determination of the composition of life insurance reserves to a determination of the meaning of the word \"assets.\" This we are not prepared to do. Section 818(a) specifically provides: SEC. 818. ACCOUNTING*184 PROVISIONS. (a) Method of Accounting. -- All computations entering into the determination of the taxes imposed by this part shall be made -- (1) under an accrual method of accounting, or (2) to the extent permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, under a combination of an accrual method of accounting with any other method permitted by this chapter (other than the cash receipts and disbursements method).*1042 Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all such computations shall be made in a manner consistent with the manner required for purposes of the annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. It seems to us that, by virtue of this provision, Congress clearly specified that, except to the extent otherwise provided, the accrual method of accounting was to control; indeed, it emphasized its mandate in this regard by limiting the broad delegation of power to prescribe regulations to \"a combination of an accrual method of accounting with any other method permitted by this chapter (other than the cash receipts and disbursements method).\" (Emphasis added.) Neither party herein disputes the proposition*185 that, since petitioner had no legal right to collect due and deferred premiums, they would not normally be includable under an accrual method of accounting. Indeed, were it not for the specific provisions in section 805, permitting life insurance reserves to be taken into account, the portion of those reserves attributable to the liability, which would have come into existence if and when the due and deferred premiums had been paid, would also not be recognized under the accrual method of accounting. In view of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the fact that Congress injected a limited modification of the normal rules of accrual accounting with respect to life insurance reserves does not justify an expansive interpretation of the word \"assets\" in section 805(b)(4). To hold otherwise would in effect result in the creation for tax purposes of an otherwise nonexistent asset. In an analogous situation, we have only recently reaffirmed our refusal to permit respondent to utilize section 482 to allocate nonexistent income. Huber Homes, Inc., 55 T.C. 598 (1971). Nor are we impressed with respondent's argument that adoption of his position is necessary*186 to prevent distortion. In point of fact, whenever amounts are added to both a numerator and denominator, the fraction is distorted from what it would have been without the additions unless the amounts so added are in the same proportion as the other amounts utilized in determining the fraction. The siren song of symmetry which underlies respondent's argument regarding distortion is beside the point. Symmetry between income and deductions is not a necessary touchstone for determining the incidence of Federal income taxation, even where such symmetry is consistent with sound accounting practice. Cf. Schlude v. Commissioner, 372 U.S. 128 (1963); American Automobile Assn. v. United States, 367 U.S. 687, 692 (1961). Perhaps there would be less distortion under respondent's method. Cf. our supplemental opinion in Western National Life Insurance Co. of Texas, 51 T.C. 824, 826-827 (1969). But this may not necessarily be *1043 so and, in any event, we are not disposed to create an accruable asset simply because the statute specifically permits an otherwise nonaccruable liability to*187 be taken into account. We so conclude, not because we consider the NAIC treatment binding upon us or respondent, but because, given the clear indication that the normal rules of accrual accounting should be applied to the taxation of life insurance companies, except as modified by statute, and the fact that the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 represents a carefully drawn, detailed framework of taxation in an unusually complicated area, we think that the word \"assets\" -- a word of ordinary usage -- should be given its accepted meaning. Cf. Commissioner v. Brown, 380 U.S. 563 (1965); Hanover Bank v. Commissioner, 369 U.S. 672 (1962); University Hill Foundation, 51 T.C. 548 (1969), on appeal (C.A. 9, July 14, 1969). In so concluding, we recognize that the three Circuit Courts of Appeals have reached a contrary decision ( Franklin Life Insurance Co. v. United States, supra;Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Co. v. United States, supra;Western National Life Insurance Co. of Texas v. Commissioner, supra),*188 but, after careful consideration, we respectfully decline to adopt their point of view. 6 We also recognize that the logic of our rationale is more consistent with our original decision in Western National Life Insurance Co. of Texas, 50 T.C. 285 (1968). However, in view of the fact that petitioner herein has conceded that due and deferred premiums should be included in \"assets\" to the extent of the net valuation premiums, i.e., with only the amount represented by loading excluded, we need now do no more than adhere to our supplemental decision in that case (51 T.C. 824) that the loading portion of due and deferred premiums should be excluded from \"assets\" as that term is used in section 805(b)(4) and we expressly leave open the question of reconsidering a return to our original position in that case. Moreover, in view of our rationale, we need not specifically address ourselves to the further argument made by petitioner that due and deferred premiums are assets, at least to the extent represented by loading, \"used by it in carrying on an insurance trade or business\" and/or have a zero basis so that they would, in any event, *189 not be recognized as \"assets\" within the meaning of section 805(b)(4). The second issue involved herein is whether the gross amount of due and deferred premiums should be included in \"gross premiums\" *1044 within the meaning of section 809(c)(1)7 in determining gain from operations for purposes of the so-called phase II tax. Starting from the premise accepted by the parties that section 809(d) specifically*190 permits a deduction, in determining gain or loss from operations, for th net increase in life insurance reserves, respondent advances the same syllogism to support his position that the entire amount of due and deferred premiums is encompassed by the phrase \"gross premiums.\" This Court has not yet ruled on this issue (see our supplemental opinion in Western National Life Insurance Co. of Texas, 51 T.C. at 830) but one Circuit Court of Appeals has accepted respondent's position ( Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Co. v. United States, supra) and another has indicated its agreement with this view although the particular issue was not before it and the taxpayer therein had conceded such an interpretation of the statute (see Franklin Life Insurance Co. v. United States, 399 F. 2d at 760). Our reasoning with respect to the includability of due and deferred premiums in \"assets\" for purposes of section 805(b)(4) applies with equal force to the interpretation of section 809(c)(1). By the same token, we note that we need not now decide whether that reasoning should be applied, in its full sweep, *191 to the interpretation of \"gross premiums\"; petitioner has conceded that, to the extent that the deduction with respect to life insurance reserves represents the net valuation portion of due and deferred premiums, an equal amount should be included in \"gross premiums\" for the purpose of determining gain from operations subject to the so-called phase II tax. Accordingly, we now do no more than hold that the loading portion of due and deferred premiums should be excluded from \"gross premiums\" as that term is used in section 809(c)(1). Decision will be entered under Rule 50. SIMPSON *192 Simpson, J., dissenting: In my judgment, I would reach a different conclusion than the majority in this case, although I do not disagree with it in principle. In his second opinion in the Western National case (51 T.C. 824 (1969)), Judge Drennen decided to construe the term \"assets,\" as used in section 805, in the light of the industry practice; in doing so, he recognized that he was not adopting the common usage of that *1045 term and that he was not applying the traditional concepts of accrual accounting. The life insurance business involves many concepts and practices which are peculiar to that business, and the income which should be subject to taxation cannot be determined without taking into consideration those peculiar concepts and practices. It is, moreover, a business which is generally subject to regulation by the States, and through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, uniform standards are established. Generally speaking, Congress has laid down the rules for determining the income of life insurance companies which is subject to Federal taxation, but in many respects, such income must be determined by reliance on*193 the industry practices established in accordance with the regulations of the NAIC. In deciding to adopt the industry's concept of what constitutes an asset for purposes of section 805, I believe Judge Drennen acted wisely. Nonetheless, I now believe that the time has come for us to abandon our own view of how the statute should be interpreted and to accept the views of the three Courts of Appeals. Western National Life Insurance Co. of Texas v. Commissioner, 432 F. 2d 298 (C.A. 5, 1970), reversing and remanding 50 T.C. 285 (1968) as modified by 51 T.C. 824 (1969); Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Co. v. United States, 408 F. 2d 842, 844 (C.A. 4, 1969); Franklin Life Insurance Co. v. United States, 399 F. 2d 757 (C.A. 7, 1968). Generally, it is our duty to decide a question in accordance with our best judgment. It would be irresponsible, in my opinion, for us to abrogate our own power to decide an issue and to accept the decision of another court merely because one other court had passed upon the question. Yet, we are not*194 wholly free to expound the law as we may see it. Of course, we are constrained to give effect to our own precedents and to follow the decision of a circuit when the law has been established by decision of the Court of Appeals for that circuit. Jack E. Golsen, 54 T.C. 742 (1970), on appeal (C.A. 10, May 4, 1970). Even when the Court of Appeals has not spoken for the circuit in which the case arises, we do give serious consideration to the views of other circuits. At times, we may decide to continue to adhere to our view even though a Court of Appeals in a different circuit takes a different position. However, if many of the circuit courts adopt a position contrary to ours, there must come a time when we accede to their views, however much we may be convinced of the correctness of our view. There is no magic in the number of three -- there is no number of contrary decisions by the circuit courts which, in my view, should automatically cause us to accede to their views. When to abandon our view must depend upon the issue in controversy and other related circumstances. In this case, the issue is complex, and although I believe Judge Drennen's opinion*195 was sound, I must recognize that it is difficult *1046 to make an overpowering argument for it. Under such circumstances, I believe that we should reconsider our position and accept the views of the circuits. No one can predict with certainty how the Sixth Circuit will decide the issue, but we can be sure that they will give great weight to the views of the other Circuit Courts of Appeals. Western National Life Insurance Co. of Texas v. Commissioner, supra;Goodenow v. Commissioner, 238 F. 2d 20 (C.A. 8, 1956). In view of the nature of the issue in controversy, it is difficult to demonstrate that those circuits were clearly erroneous, and it is difficult to give cogent reasons why the Sixth Circuit should not follow them. It is most unlikely that the Sixth Circuit will not adopt the same position as the other circuits. For us to persist in our view under such circumstances forces a party to further litigation, when it should not be necessary. In this case, the burden will be placed upon the Government, but in tomorrow's case, it might fall on the taxpayer. Footnotes 1.

The three circuits which have passed on this issue are the Seventh, Fourth, and Fifth.

Findings of Fact Petitioner, a Florida corporation, was formed pursuant to an agreement between H. T. Broders and Horine Holding Company dated June 2, 1934. The agreement recites that Horine, as an unsatisfied creditor, had acquired interests in real estate known as Silver Bluff Estates, Inc., in Miami. Horine desired to liquidate its interests in this real estate and desired the services of Broders in this connection. Horine agreed to have formed a Florida corporation \"for the purpose of acquiring title, legal and/or equitable, to all properties above referred to.\" Horine further bound itself \"to cause the necessary steps*171 to be taken to have the legal title to all of the property referred to herein transferred to H. T. Broders and Morgan Van Valkenburgh as successor trustees for the use and benefit of the corporation to be formed.\" The agreement contemplated that Broders would be employed by the new corporation to \"rehabilitate, sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of the new corporation.\" All moneys realized from the liquidation were to be distributed to Broders and Horine in proportions next described after the payment of operating expenses \"including funds necessary to the reimbursement to the party of the first part [Horine] for all monies advanced for the purpose of organizing the corporation referred to * * *\". After the payment of such expenses any amounts remaining in excess of $1,000 were to be paid 65 per cent to Horine, and 35 per cent to Broders. This ratio of distribution was to continue until Horine had received a total of $21,000, after which time Broders was to receive 50 per cent of the distributions. It was agreed that 100 shares of no par common stock would be authorized and distributed, 49 shares to Horine, 1 share to Van Valkenburgh and 10 shares to Broders. The*172 remaining 40 shares were to be placed in escrow to be subsequently delivered to Broders as next described. When Horine received in distributions from the proposed company the respective aggregate amounts of $5,250, $10,500, $15,750 and $21,000, Broders was to receive, respectively, an additional 10 shares from the escrow holder. In this manner, after Horine had received $21,000, Broders would have 50 shares of stock. The stock, while in escrow, could not be voted. The agreement provided that the proposed company would have three directors, Broders, Van Valkenburg and a person selected by Horine. It was agreed that the directors would elect Broders president and manager, Van Valkenburg vice-president and treasurer, and the secretary to be named by Horine, and that these oficers would be reelected annually \"so long as the corporation may exist, and until said assets shall have been fully liquidated and distributed, as herein provided.\" Petitioner was formed pursuant to the above described agreement and its by-laws included a copy of such agreement. The by-laws, in this connection, stated: \"It being the intention of the incorporators of Silver Bluffs Estates, Inc., that the future*173 management and affairs of this corporation be conducted in accordance with the intent of that certain Agreement * * * dated June 2 1934, and the said Agreement is herein set out and made a part of these by-laws.\" The by-laws further provided that dividends \"shall be declared in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement dated June 2, 1934, * * *.\" During its existence petitioner was operated substantially in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Shares of stock were issued as proposed and without any capital contributions therefor by the stockholders. Horine advanced $500 to petitioner at the time of its organization, which amount was repaid to Horine by petitioner from receipts from the liquidation. The title to the property involved was vested in Broders and Van Valkenburgh as trustees. The deeds of conveyances in selling the realty being liquidated were executed by the trustees. Petitioner was not a party to these conveyances. The money received by the trustees, as liquidation of the property progressed, was deposited in petitioner's bank account and the expenses of rehabilitation, maintenance and liquidation were paid by petitioner from these funds. Any funds remaining*174 were from time to time distributed by petitioner to Horine and Broders as provided in the June 2 agreement. Prior to 1944 petitioner filed returns reporting as its income the gain derived from the liquidation of the properties. Thereafter, it filed returns but did not report as its income any such gains. On May 31, 1946, petitioner was dissolved and Broders and Van Valkenburgh, under a supplemental agreement, are carrying on the functions previously performed by petitioner. Opinion The question is whether income realized from the liquidation process during the taxable year is taxable to petitioner. Respondent argues it is because petitioner as a corporate and taxable entity can not be disregarded and that therefore the income in question must be attributed to it for tax purposes. Petitioner contends that it was just an agent or conduit in respect of the income and is not, therefore, taxable. We think petitioner is not taxable. Petitioner was formed pursuant to and subject to the terms of the June 2, 1934, agreement. This agreement provided that the petitioner would distribute the proceeds of the liquidation in a certain manner. This provision ante-dated petitioner's creation*175 and petitioner was created subject to this requirement and for the purpose of satisfying it. There was no right, power or discretion in petitioner with respect to the disposition of the income in question. Petitioner did not, after its creation, obligate itself to distribute the income a certain way. Petitioner was powerless to have assumed such obligation. Petitioner's lack of command over the income is not the result of ignoring petitioner as a corporate or taxable entity but is a result of the agreement which prescribed and controlled the disposition of the income involved. In this respect the instant case differs from , wherein the Court said: \"There was no actual contract of agency, nor the usual incidents of an agency relationship.\" Since, in our opinion, command over the income is the essential matter here we do not consider it necessary to determine where ownership of the property being liquidated lay. Nor do we think petitioner's distribution of the income can in any way be confused with dividends. Even if called such, the distributions were not the result of petitioner's authority to declare them. Nor did*176 the directors or stockholders have power to alter the pattern or character of the distributions since these were governed by the basic agreement of June 2, 1934. Furthermore, the distributions did not correspond with stock ownership. The fact that prior to 1944 petitioner returned income from the liquidation as its own does not affect our conclusion. Convinced as we are that petitioner had no command over the income in question, we hold that petitioner is not liable for any tax on it. See .

Per Curiam:* Jose Delfides Flores-Lopez pled guilty to illegal reentry. After this court vacated his initial sentence in a prior appeal, the district court adopted a Sentencing Guidelines range of 30 to 37 months in prison and imposed a term of 46 months. Flores-Lopez argues that this sentence is procedurally * Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.

This court recognizes three types of sentences: (1) a sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines range, (2) a sentence that includes a departure as authorized by the Guidelines, and (3) a variance outside the Guidelines. United States v. Brantley, 537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir. 2008). Because Flores-Lopez’s sentence can be affirmed as a variance, we need not address his challenge to its propriety as a departure. See United States v. Gas Pipe, Inc., 997 F.3d 231, 242 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 484 (2021). Our review of substantive reasonableness in sentencing is for an abuse of discretion. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). The record shows that the district court listened to Flores-Lopez and his counsel, considered the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, and made an individualized assessment based on the facts of the case. Although Flores-Lopez suggests the district court could not rely on factors already incorporated by the Guidelines to support a variance, he is mistaken. See Brantley, 537 F.3d at 350.

Oldham, Circuit Judge: * In accordance with powers vested in him by the Texas Legislature, Governor Greg Abbott promulgated Executive Order GA-38 to unify the State’s response to COVID-19. Among other things, GA-38 prohibited * Judge Willett concurs in the judgment and in parts I and II.C of the opinion. Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 2 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 school districts from imposing mask mandates. Some students sued. Then the district court permanently enjoined the Texas Attorney General from enforcing GA-38. We hold, however, that the district court lacked subject- matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, we vacate the district court’s injunction and remand with instructions to dismiss the suit without prejudice. I. GA-38 provides that “[n]o governmental entity, including a . . . school district . . . , and no government official may require any person to wear a face covering or to mandate another person wear a face covering.” GA-38 has “the force and effect of law.” Tex. Gov’t Code § 418.012. Plaintiffs are children with disabilities attending Texas public schools. On August 17, 2021, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in federal district court challenging GA-38 and related Public Health Guidance from the Texas Education Agency (“TEA”). The original complaint included 14 plaintiffs, who were “students with disabilities and underlying medical conditions which carry an increased risk of serious complications or death in the event that they contract COVID-19.” It named as defendants Governor Abbott, the TEA, and TEA Commissioner Mike Morath. The original complaint included three claims: (1) violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) against Abbott and Morath in their official capacities, (2) violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 against all defendants, and (3) federal preemption under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARP Act”) against all defendants. Plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs amended their complaint twice before trial. First, on September 1, they amended their complaint to add the Attorney General as a defendant. Second, a week before trial, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint with leave of court, adding a new claim and subtracting some 2 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 3 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 plaintiffs and a defendant. The new claim alleged the ADA and Rehabilitation Act preempted GA-38. Seven plaintiffs exited the suit, and the seven remaining plaintiffs dropped their claims against the Governor. After denying plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, the district court held a bench trial and entered a permanent injunction and final judgment against the Attorney General. The court held that plaintiffs have standing to sue. It then declared that GA-38 violates Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. It further held that, insofar as it applies to school districts, GA-38 is preempted by the ADA, Section 504, and the ARP Act. The court enjoined the Attorney General from enforcing the Executive Order. The Attorney General sought a stay pending appeal, which the district court denied. But we granted the stay and expedited the appeal. II. “Article III jurisdiction is always first. Here, it’s also last.” Shrimpers & Fishermen of RGV v. Tex. Comm’n on Env’t Quality, 968 F.3d 419, 426 (5th Cir. 2020) (Oldham, J., concurring) (citations omitted). To invoke our jurisdiction, plaintiffs must satisfy the familiar tripartite test for Article III standing: (A) an injury in fact; (B) that’s fairly traceable to the defendant’s conduct; and (C) that’s likely redressable by a favorable decision. See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992); see also Env’t Tex. Citizen Lobby, Inc. v. ExxonMobil Corp., 968 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir. 2020) (“Because this case was tried, Plaintiffs needed to prove standing by a preponderance of the evidence.”). All three elements are missing here. A. Plaintiffs have not presented an injury in fact sufficient to satisfy Article III. To establish such an injury, plaintiffs must show they “suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is ‘concrete and particularized’ 3 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 4 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 and ‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). Plaintiffs haven’t carried that burden here because (1) the injury they’ve alleged is not a cognizable injury in fact, and (2) they may not relabel their injury as something it’s not. 1. Plaintiffs’ alleged injury is the increased risk they face of contracting COVID-19 in school without mask mandates and experiencing complications or severe symptoms from a COVID-19 infection. They rely on their doctors’ statements that “[i]n order to decrease [plaintiffs’] risk,” everyone around them “should observe strict COVID-19 safety protocols and wear a mask indoors.” Plaintiffs further contend that, without mask mandates, it is “simply too dangerous” for them to attend in-person school. To establish an injury in fact, plaintiffs must show an “invasion of a legally protected interest” that is both “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339 (quotation omitted). This circuit does not “recognize the concept of probabilistic standing based on a non-particularized increased risk—that is, an increased risk that equally affects the general public.” Shrimpers, 968 F.3d at 424 (quotation omitted). And even where increased-risk claims are particularized, they generally “cannot satisfy the actual or imminent requirement,” which necessitates “evidence of a certainly impending harm or substantial risk of harm.” Ibid. (quotation omitted); see also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA, 937 F.3d 533, 537 n.2 (5th Cir. 2019) (“[A]ny difference between ‘certainly impending’ and ‘substantial risk’ is immaterial here.”). That’s because “[m]uch government regulation slightly increases a citizen’s risk of injury—or insufficiently decreases the risk compared to what some citizens might prefer.” Shrimpers, 968 F.3d at 424 (quoting Pub. 4 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 5 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 Citizen, Inc. v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 489 F.3d 1279, 1295 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). And “[o]pening the courthouse to these kinds of increased-risk claims would drain the ‘actual or imminent’ requirement of meaning.” Ibid. (quoting Pub. Citizen, 489 F.3d at 1295). Plaintiffs’ increased risk of contracting COVID-19 fails to satisfy these requirements. There is no way to understand plaintiffs’ trial evidence as establishing COVID-19 infections are “certainly impending” in schools without mask mandates, but not in schools mandating masks. Shrimpers, 968 F.3d at 425. At the time of trial, two of plaintiffs’ seven schools were mask- optional (in compliance with GA-38), and five mandated masks (in violation of GA-38). The two mask-optional schools had positivity rates of 1.9 and 3.0 percent. The five schools with mask mandates measured at 0.3, 1.1, 2.3, 4.9, and 5.4 percent—higher, lower, and in between the rates from the mask- optional schools. Moreover, plaintiffs did nothing to control for their schools’ various other efforts to reduce COVID-19 infections, and hence did nothing to prove the relative efficacy of mask mandates in the five law- violating schools. Cf. Dominguez v. UAL Corp., 666 F.3d 1359, 1363 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (concluding antitrust plaintiff’s alleged injury was “speculative at best” because it failed to take into account numerous variables at play); Finkelman v. Nat’l Football League, 810 F.3d 187, 202 (3d Cir. 2016) (similar); Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, 405 F.3d 964, 985 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding alleged injury did “not rise to the level of certainty required to establish an injury in fact” where injury depended on a “series of substantial variables, over which [the plaintiff] himself had utterly no control”); cf. also Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976) (“[U]nadorned speculation will not suffice to invoke the federal judicial power.”); United Transp. Union v. ICC, 891 F.2d 908, 915 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (“Any one of the factors discussed above might be enough to place the petitioner’s allegation in the category of unadorned speculation, and therefore to deny standing; taken together, 5 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 6 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 petitioner’s claim of injury seems but a shadow in the mist.” (quotation omitted)). Plaintiffs’ risks of complications from COVID-19 likewise do not satisfy Article III. Here too, plaintiffs lack evidence sufficient to show this “allegation of future injury” is “certainly impending” as a result of GA-38. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014); see also Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990) (“[W]e have said many times before and reiterate today: Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art. III. A threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.” (quotation omitted)); Shrimpers, 968 F.3d at 424 (“[E]ven if a petitioner’s increased-risk harms are particularized, they also must be actual or imminent.”). In light of widely available vaccines and the schools’ other mitigation efforts, “the odds” of any particular plaintiff contracting COVID-19 and subsequently suffering complications are “speculative,” and “the time (if ever) when any such [infection] would occur is entirely uncertain.” Pub. Citizen, 489 F.3d at 1293–94. To be sure, “imminence” is “a somewhat elastic concept.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2; see also Ghedi v. Mayorkas, 16 F.4th 456, 465 n.36 (5th Cir. 2021) (describing “imminence” as “an elastic concept that turns on a sufficiently high degree of likelihood of future injury” (quotation omitted)). But the concept “cannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes—that the injury is certainly impending.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2 (quotation omitted). And it “has been stretched beyond the breaking point where, as here, the plaintiff alleges only an injury at some indefinite future time.” Ibid.; see also Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 415 (2013) (rejecting standing based on “fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending”). 6 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 7 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 Even the district court, which entered a permanent injunction against enforcement of the Executive Order, could not say that GA-38 creates a “certainly impending harm or substantial risk of harm” to plaintiffs. Shrimpers, 968 F.3d at 424. Instead, the district court excused plaintiffs from showing such proof. In the district court’s words, plaintiffs need not show “enforcement of GA-38 will actually cause any of them to contract COVID or that they would actually contract COVID in a mask-optional school environment.” That conclusion is remarkable, and it squarely conflicts with the precedents described above. 2. Perhaps recognizing that the increased-risk claims face insurmountable roadblocks, both the district court and plaintiffs attempted to reframe the relevant injury. The district court, for example, characterized the injury as “the deprivation of reasonable access to in-person schooling.” On appeal, plaintiffs argue they are injured by “deprivation of access to in-person schooling on an equal basis with their non-disabled peers.” And they contend the “core” of their claimed equal-access injury is “denial of case-by-case decisionmaking.” The dissent adopts this characterization. See post, at 5 (characterizing plaintiffs’ injury as being denied “an opportunity to participate in public education . . . that is equal to that enjoyed by students without disabilities”). There are at least four problems with this approach. First, arguments in favor of jurisdiction can be forfeited. Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 937 F.3d at 542. At successive stages of this litigation, plaintiffs have changed their standing theory from “increased risk” to “reasonable access” to “equal access.” The forfeiture rules—which apply to arguments in favor of standing as they do to other arguments in federal litigation, see ibid.—prohibit such efforts to move the goalposts. 7 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 8 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 Second, federal courts must consider plaintiffs’ actual injury—not the labels plaintiffs put on that injury. As the leading treatise observes, the law of standing is fraught with the danger that plaintiffs will engage in “artful pleading” to make an end-run around the strictures of Article III. See R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 124–25 (7th ed. 2015); Clapper, 568 U.S. at 401 (expressing concerns about attempts to “manufacture standing” where injuries are otherwise too speculative to satisfy Article III); see also Cass R. Sunstein, Standing and the Privatization of Public Law, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1432, 1464–65 (1988) (“The central problem . . . is how to characterize the relevant injury . . . . [Once] recharacterized, [otherwise-speculative] injuries are not speculative at all.”). Third, plaintiffs misunderstand the relevant legal question. What matters for Article III is whether plaintiffs “suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest.” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339 (emphasis added) (quotation omitted). Neither the ADA nor Section 504 creates a legally protected interest in equality simpliciter. Rather, those statutes legally protect reasonable access to covered facilities and benefits. And they require covered entities to facilitate such access by way of reasonable accommodations. So ADA plaintiffs aren’t necessarily injured every time their method of access differs from that of their non-disabled peers—they’re injured when they are denied the reasonable access the statutes protect. It’s no answer to say, as plaintiffs do, that they prefer one accommodation to all others. It’s well settled that defendants—not plaintiffs—get to choose between reasonable accommodation(s), and plaintiffs’ preferences between reasonable accommodation(s) are irrelevant. See, e.g., Cadena v. El Paso Cnty., 946 F.3d 717, 725 (5th Cir. 2020) (“[An ADA defendant] is not required to acquiesce to [a plaintiff’s] choice of 8 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 9 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 accommodations . . . . But it is required to provide her with reasonable accommodations that give meaningful access to the benefit.” (quotation omitted)). Take, for example, plaintiffs’ analogy to “a student who must rely on a wheelchair.” In that situation, the school might accommodate the student in a number of ways: it might install a lift, a ramp, or something else. It can choose any reasonable one. The fact that a particular student prefers a lift to a ramp is irrelevant, so long as the school picks a reasonable accommodation that provides meaningful access. So too here. All agree that plaintiffs have a legally protected interest in reasonable access to their schools. And the schools, in turn, have numerous alternatives for mitigating the risks of COVID-19 so plaintiffs have such access. The schools can adopt policies regarding vaccines, plexiglass, hand sanitizer, social distancing, and more. Plaintiffs have not even attempted to show that one or any combination of these accommodations is insufficient to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 to a level low enough that plaintiffs can attend school. They have simply said that they prefer one accommodation— masks—to all others. Therefore, they cannot show that they have suffered an invasion of the legal interest the relevant statutes protect. 1 Fourth, there’s no basis for plaintiffs’ claim that GA-38 denies them something the ADA guarantees—namely, the right to “individualized” or “case-by-case decisionmaking.” It’s true that the ADA entitles disabled students who inform their school of a disability to an “individualized assessment” of their needs. It’s also irrelevant because the record contains no evidence that any of these plaintiffs ever requested an accommodation from anyone. See Windham v. Harris Cnty., 875 F.3d 229, 236–37 (5th Cir. 1 To the extent holding plaintiffs to their jurisdictional burden implicates the merits of their ADA claims, the merits are relevant only insofar as they are “intertwined” with plaintiffs’ theory of injury. See Brownback v. King, 141 S. Ct. 740, 749 (2021). 9 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 10 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 2017) (“[B]ecause the ADA does not require clairvoyance, the burden falls on the plaintiff . . . to request an accommodation in direct and specific terms.” (quotation omitted)). Moreover, the record supplies no reason to think any student would be denied such case-by-case determinations if plaintiffs in fact requested them. Nor does GA-38 in any way prevent case- by-case decisionmaking. It simply eliminates one option—a mask mandate— and retains all others. It is plainly within the State’s power to remove one possible accommodation from consideration, so long as other reasonable options remain. And it is transparently wrong to equate the State’s course of action with “[d]enying the children individualized assessment of their needs.” Here, all agree plaintiffs have physical access to their classrooms. All agree all seven schools take a multi-pronged approach to COVID-19 mitigation. All agree plaintiffs, their classmates, and their teachers are welcome to wear masks and ask those around them to wear masks. All agree plaintiffs presented zero evidence that anyone—let alone “individual[s] working constantly with a disabled child,” post, at 1 n.1—would refuse a request to wear a mask or take comparable safety measures while working closely with a vulnerable student. And all agree at least some of the plaintiffs are committed to attending in-person classes, whether or not their schools mandate masks. Therefore, even if plaintiffs could recharacterize their injury as denial of reasonable access to schools, plaintiffs failed to show they have suffered or certainly will suffer such an injury. B. Even if plaintiffs could show injury in fact, they could not carry their burden to establish traceability. Article III requires them to show “a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not 10 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 11 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (quotation omitted); see also Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 937 F.3d at 542. So plaintiffs must show a causal connection between the Attorney General’s enforcement of GA-38 (the challenged action) and their increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and suffering complications (their asserted injury). 2 Where a suit challenges a government action regulating someone other than plaintiffs themselves, it is “ordinarily substantially more difficult” to establish the needed causal connection. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (quotation omitted). That’s because when the “asserted injury arises from the government’s allegedly unlawful regulation . . . of someone else,” causation will “ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third party . . . and perhaps on the response of others as well.” Ibid. That makes it plaintiffs’ burden to show—with the same “manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation”—that those regulated third parties’ “choices have been or will be made in such a manner as to produce causation.” Id. at 561–62. 2 Plaintiffs wrongly contend that it’s the Attorney General’s responsibility to raise traceability. “As the party invoking federal jurisdiction, the plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that they have standing.” TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2207 (2021) (emphasis added). That means “arguments in favor of standing, like all arguments in favor of jurisdiction, can be forfeited or waived.” Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 937 F.3d at 542 (emphasis added). But the same cannot be said for arguments against jurisdiction: Our court, like every federal court, “has a continuing obligation to assure itself of its own jurisdiction, sua sponte if necessary.” Green Valley Special Utility Dist. v. City of Schertz, 969 F.3d 460, 468 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (quotation omitted); see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 93 (1998). That means even if the Attorney General had said not a single word about traceability at any point in this case, we would be nonetheless obligated to ensure plaintiffs have established the “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61. The dissent also misplaces the jurisdictional burden. See post, at 10. 11 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 12 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 This case demonstrates how heavy that burden is. Plaintiffs must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Attorney General’s enforcement of GA-38 caused their injury. See Env’t Tex. Citizen Lobby, 968 F.3d at 367. But because GA-38 doesn’t regulate plaintiffs—it regulates the school districts—plaintiffs must make an additional showing. Plaintiffs must show (1) the Attorney General’s enforcement of GA-38 caused the school districts to drop their mask mandates, and (2) plaintiffs’ increased-risk injuries resulted from the school districts’ elimination of mask mandates. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562; see also Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979) (“A plaintiff who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute’s operation or enforcement.” (emphasis added)). Plaintiffs cannot come close to that showing. On the first point, it’s undisputed the Attorney General’s enforcement activity did not cause five of the seven plaintiffs’ schools to eliminate their masking requirements. As the parties stipulated at the time of trial, those schools maintained their mask mandates despite the Governor’s issuance of GA-38, despite receiving “threatening letter[s]” from the Attorney General, and despite the Attorney General actually suing some school districts. So at least with respect to five of the plaintiffs’ schools, plaintiffs cannot establish the first link in the causal chain: Their school districts refused to eliminate mask mandates, regardless of what the Attorney General said or did. But even if the Attorney General’s enforcement of GA-38 caused plaintiffs’ schools not to mandate masks, plaintiffs still could not trace their increased-risk injuries back to the Executive Order. As discussed in Part II.A, supra, plaintiffs failed to identify any increased risk of contracting COVID-19 resulting from the prohibition on mask mandates, and any increased risk of suffering complications from a hypothetical COVID-19 infection is even more attenuated. But even assuming plaintiffs could show those increased 12 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 13 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 risks, they could be attributed to any number of variables that have nothing to do with mask mandates. Those include innumerable differences in the way plaintiffs’ schools—each an independent actor—have chosen to address COVID-19. See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 & n.5 (holding the uncontrollable actions of independent third-parties make it difficult or impossible to trace plaintiffs’ injuries to defendants’ conduct); see also id. at 417 n.7 (“To the extent that [plaintiffs’ predictions about how third parties will react] are based on anything other than conjecture . . . they do not establish injury that is fairly traceable [to the government’s action].”). Plaintiffs have done nothing to control those independent variables. All of this presumably explains why the entirety of the district court’s factual finding on this point is this: “the use of masks may decrease the risk of COVID infection in group settings.” 3 That finding fails to support plaintiffs’ contention that mask mandates are the only way they can adequately reduce the risks of COVID-19. It says nothing about allowing but not requiring masks. It says nothing about masks’ relative efficacy vis-à-vis other mitigation measures. And it says nothing about school environments generally or plaintiffs’ schools specifically. It therefore warrants no weight. See Int’l Energy Ventures Mgmt., LLC v. United Energy Grp., Ltd., 999 F.3d 257, 268 (5th Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 2752 (2022) (mem.). 3 The dissent takes pains to “emphasize that this case was tried to the bench, and the district court . . . entered detailed findings of fact.” Post, at 4. But neither the dissent nor the plaintiffs identified factual findings other than this one, let alone multiple “detailed” factual findings. See Oral Arg. at 24:40–26:35 (responding to request to identify relevant factual findings in the district court opinion, plaintiffs’ counsel pointed to the court’s finding that “the use of masks may decrease the risk of COVID infection in group settings”). 13 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 14 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 C. Even if plaintiffs could meet their burden on injury in fact and traceability, they still would not be able to show their injuries are likely redressable by a favorable decision. As with traceability, when an asserted injury arises from the government’s regulation of someone other than the plaintiffs, “redressability [will] ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third party.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. And that makes a plaintiff’s choice of defendant especially important. Because if they don’t sue the regulated third party, they leave redressability to turn on “the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or predict.” Ibid. (quotation omitted). And whether or not they bring the regulated parties before the court, plaintiffs’ redressability burden remains the same: They must at least show that the regulated parties “will likely react in predictable ways.” California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2117 (2021) (quotation omitted). “Plaintiffs cannot rely on speculation” about the choices the regulated parties might make. Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562). Here, plaintiffs rely wholly on speculation about the unfettered choices made by actors not before our court. Plaintiffs chose not to sue their school districts. The school districts have the unfettered choice—with or without GA-38, and with or without any involvement by the Attorney General—to drop their mask mandates at any time. And indeed they have. None of plaintiffs’ schools require masks today. And we could not enjoin those schools to impose mask mandates if we wanted to because plaintiffs did not sue them. That alone proves that plaintiffs’ claims are not redressable. 14 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 15 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 Plaintiffs chose instead to sue the Attorney General. And what does the Attorney General have to do with plaintiffs’ increased risks from COVID-19? Nothing. He does not set masking policies. Nor can he order the school districts to adopt masking policies (as evidenced by several schools’ refusals to abide by GA-38 or the Attorney General’s threatened enforcement of it). And even if we affirmed the district court’s permanent injunction against the Attorney General, the school districts could drop (and as noted above, have dropped) their mask mandates anyway. That would expose plaintiffs to the exact same risks they otherwise impute to GA-38, and no amount of equitable relief against the Attorney General will redress anything. Plaintiffs effectively concede this point by arguing not that an injunction against the Attorney General would redress their injuries, but rather that an injunction would “clear[] the way” to allow third parties (namely, their schools) to redress their injuries. 4 But that’s not how redressability works. For example, in Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405 (5th Cir. 2001) (en banc), abortionists sought a declaration that a provision of Louisiana law was unconstitutional because it authorized private suits in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. We held that plaintiffs’ purported injuries could not be redressed by an order against defendants—the Governor and the Attorney General—who had no power over the third parties who might bring suits. See id. at 426–27. It was irrelevant there, as here, that an order in plaintiffs’ favor might clear the way for them to vindicate their rights against non-parties. See id. at 453 (Parker, J., dissenting). 4 At trial, plaintiffs argued that “but for GA-38, these seven schools would have a universal mask mandate.” Plaintiffs have not made that argument on appeal. 15 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 16 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 It is no answer to say, as plaintiffs do, that a permanent injunction against the Attorney General partially redresses their injuries and hence satisfies the Article III minimum. It’s true that a partial remedy is constitutionally sufficient. See Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 141 S. Ct. 792, 801 (2021) (recognizing nominal damages as sufficient to satisfy redressability requirement despite not providing “full redress”). It’s also irrelevant here. Even with the district court’s robust injunction against the Attorney General, all seven of the plaintiffs’ schools could—and in fact did—eliminate their mask mandates. Thus the injunction is not a partial remedy of their alleged injuries; it’s no remedy at all. * * * Finally, a word about the scope of plaintiffs’ theory of injury and the limitlessness of the dissent. According to plaintiffs and our esteemed colleague in dissent, Article III of the Constitution gives plaintiffs standing to demand court-created mask-mandate bubbles. This case involves schools. But plaintiffs’ theory, shared by the dissent, would reach every property covered by the ADA and Section 504. Restaurants, movie theaters, libraries, hotels, grocery stores, you name it. It would require federal courts to enforce mobile mask mandates that go where plaintiffs go and require everyone around them to wear masks. That theory of standing is equal parts sweeping and unprecedented. Today we reject it. The district court’s injunction is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED with instructions to DISMISS the case for lack of jurisdiction. 16 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 17 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 W. Eugene Davis, Circuit Judge, dissenting: The parents of seven severely disabled children, highly susceptible to contracting COVID-19, brought this straightforward disability discrimination lawsuit against defendant-appellant, Texas Attorney General Kenneth Paxton (“Paxton”). They sought to enjoin Paxton’s aggressive enforcement of Executive Order GA-38 which on its face prohibited the school districts from imposing even a limited mask mandate as an accommodation under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA” or “Section 504”) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA” or “Title II”) to protect these children. The injunction issued by the district court does not require the school districts to impose a mask mandate; it simply gives them the power to do so if they find plaintiffs (or any of them) are unable to attend in-school classes without even a limited mask mandate. 1 Based on GA-38 and Paxton’s enforcement of it, plaintiffs contend that they are effectively excluded from in-school classes because of their disabilities and the dire consequences they face if they contract COVID-19. More specifically, based on unchallenged evidence, they established that without some type of mask mandate, they cannot attend classes during the pandemic, and they are unfairly deprived of the valuable benefit of attending school, in violation of Section 504 and the ADA. Because the district court found uncontradicted evidence that the defendant’s enforcement of GA-38 was the only impediment to a school district’s granting a modification required by Section 504 and Title II to allow plaintiffs to attend school safely, the injunction was appropriate. 1 To be clear, the sweeping order prevents the school districts from granting a modification, for example, to require an individual working constantly with a disabled child to wear a mask. Similarly, a mask mandate limited to staff members working in one room or wing of the school with disabled children would violate GA-38. 17 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 18 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 The majority found plaintiffs had no standing based in part on their erroneous assumption that plaintiffs had brought a simple “fear of COVID- 19” case rather than the disability discrimination case that they pled and tried. In my view, plaintiffs proved each element of standing, and I strongly disagree with the majority’s contrary conclusion. Further, I conclude that the district court correctly issued the injunction against the defendant’s enforcement of GA-38. I. Plaintiffs-appellees, E.T., J.R., S.P., M.P., E.S., H.M., and A.M., are children with disabilities who attend public schools in Texas. The children’s disabilities include Down syndrome, asthma, hypogammaglobulinemia, CD 19 deficiency, growth hormone deficiency, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bronchiectasis, spina bifida, epilepsy, heart defects, and cerebral palsy. Because of their disabilities and based on the testimony of their personal physicians, the district court found that because of their heightened susceptibility of contracting COVID-19 and, if contracted, a heightened risk of severe illness or death from it, the children could not safely attend school where they would be in close proximity to unmasked students or staff members. On July 29, 2021, Texas Governor Greg Abbot issued GA-38, which bars any state entity, including school districts, from requiring that any individual wear a mask. After Governor Abbott issued GA-38, Paxton undertook a campaign against Texas’s independent school districts (“ISDs”) threatening to enforce the Order. His office sent at least 98 letters to different ISDs, filed 15 separate lawsuits, and made public statements on Twitter expressing his willingness to continue litigating against non- compliant ISDs. Further, under Paxton’s instructions, the Texas Education 18 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 19 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 Authority (“TEA”), maintained a public list of non-compliant ISDs on its website. Plaintiffs filed a complaint in district court on August 17, 2021. They alleged that GA-38 prevents school districts from imposing mask mandates as a reasonable modification for plaintiffs and other students with disabilities who are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and suffering severe illness or death as a result of the disease. They asserted disability discrimination claims under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA. Plaintiffs contend that Paxton directly discriminated against them on the basis of their disabilities, and/or indirectly caused their ISDs to discriminate against them on the basis of their disabilities. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar Paxton’s enforcement of GA-38. After a bench trial, the district court concluded, as relevant here, that GA-38 is preempted “to the extent that it interferes with local school districts’ ability to satisfy their obligations under the ADA and Section 504 and their implementing regulations.” The court recognized that the ADA and Section 504 impose “an affirmative obligation [on public entities] to make reasonable modifications in their policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless they can show that so doing would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.” 2 The court found that GA-38 prohibits the use of mask mandates, including targeted and limited ones, even when a school district determines that “requiring masks is a reasonable modification necessary to enable a student with disabilities to have equal access to a safe, integrated, in- person learning environment.” 2 See 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(7)(i). 19 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 20 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 Accordingly, the district court concluded that “to the extent that school districts cannot comply with GA-38’s ban on mask requirements and at the same time meet their obligations under the ADA and Section 504, the ADA and Section 504 supersede any conflicting provisions of GA-38.” To that end, the court issued a final judgment declaring, in relevant part, that GA-38’s ban on mask mandates as applied to school districts is preempted by Title II and Section 504, and enjoining Paxton and his office from enforcing GA-38 as applied to school districts. II. At the outset, I emphasize that this case was tried to the bench, and the district court, based on essentially uncontradicted evidence, entered detailed findings of fact. The plaintiffs produced evidence from their personal physicians attesting to plaintiffs’ severe disabilities and giving their strong opinions that, because of their disabilities, they should not attend classes where students and staff they were near were not wearing masks. They testified that when the action was filed and tried, the plaintiffs were not eligible for vaccinations against COVID-19 and that in any event no option except requiring staff and students in contact with them to wear masks would give plaintiffs adequate protection from COVID-19 given the dire consequences plaintiffs could suffer. Plaintiffs also produced evidence that the schools they attended had mask mandates in place until GA-38 was issued, and the defendant began aggressively threatening the ISDs with lawsuits and fines if they required students and staff to wear masks. The majority holds that plaintiffs failed to establish standing. Judge Oldham, the writing judge, concluded that plaintiffs established none of the elements of standing: injury, traceability, and redressability. Judge Willett agreed their injury is not redressable; in effect, finding that plaintiffs should 20 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 21 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 have sued the ISDs, not Paxton. In my view, plaintiffs alleged and proved each element of standing. A. As an initial matter, the writing judge mischaracterized plaintiffs’ claimed injury as an “increased risk of contracting COVID-19.” 3 This characterization of plaintiffs’ claimed injury ignores the claim alleged and tried: that Paxton’s conduct caused disability discrimination. Plaintiffs’ theory has always been that Paxton’s enforcement of GA-38 qualifies as disability discrimination that is prohibited by the ADA and RA. Plaintiffs proved that they have been, or imminently will be, injured by GA-38’s ban of mask requirements, because that ban denies them an opportunity to participate in public education—in which they have a legally protected interest 4—that is equal to that enjoyed by students without disabilities. While all students bear some health risks by attending school in person during the ongoing pandemic, the district court found, and it is undisputed, that these plaintiffs face a much higher risk to their health because of their disabilities. Plaintiffs presented evidence that they each require mask mandates to remain safe while they are indoors, and defendant neither challenged that evidence nor offered credible evidence of another effective option that would protect them. 5 Despite this, defendant is aggressively enforcing GA-38, which forbids school districts from requiring masks as a reasonable modification—no matter the circumstances—and 3 To support his conclusion that this is a “fear of COVID-19” case, the writing judge relies on Shrimpers & Fishermen of RGV v. Texas Comm’n on Env’t Quality, 968 F.3d 419, 424 (5th Cir. 2020) (per curiam). 4 See Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 574 (1975). 5 The only evidence the defendant offered was a mass of raw data showing COVID- 19 positivity rates in Texas public schools. 21 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 22 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 instead relegates plaintiffs to taking their classes remotely, rather than accepting a greater risk to their health and safety by going to school. Two plaintiffs have already suffered this injury: both M.P. and E.S. are enrolled in schools that rescinded their masking requirements in response to GA-38, although at time of filing their ISDs had not rescinded their mask mandates. The remaining five plaintiffs’ injuries were imminent. Their injuries were “certainly impending”— that is, that there was a “substantial risk that the harm [would] occur.” 6 And although several of plaintiffs’ school districts had mask mandates in place at the time of trial, they were vulnerable to the sting of civil sanctions defendant threatened them with. 7 Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated a substantial risk of injury. All these vulnerable students are suffering (or are at substantial risk of suffering) an injury sufficient to confer standing: if they choose in-person school, they are compelled to accept a far higher risk to their health than is required of students without disabilities. 8 These students need not prove that access to school is impossible; it is enough that GA-38 removes the tool that 6 Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 7 See Brackeen v. Haaland, 994 F.3d 249, 371 n.17 (5th Cir. 2021) (en banc), petition for cert. pending, Nos. 21-380, 21-376, 21-378 (filed Sept. 8, 2021). 8 This injury is obviously concrete. The Supreme Court has instructed that, to determine whether an injury is concrete, courts must ask whether the asserted injury has “a close relationship to a harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts.” TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2204 (2021) (citing Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341 (2016)). And, this injury could not be more personal—it prevents each plaintiff from attending school with their classmates, a recognized harm. 22 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 23 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 the record shows would afford them an opportunity to participate in in- person schooling equal to that enjoyed by students without disabilities. 9 In short, plaintiffs have satisfied Article III’s injury requirement. The discriminatory denial of equal access to education is a concrete harm, is particularized to each plaintiff, and has actually materialized. B. Paxton did not challenge traceability in his brief to this Court, for good reason; plaintiffs clearly established traceability. Under this element, plaintiffs must show “a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.” 10 But Article III requires only “de facto causation.” 11 At trial, plaintiffs introduced uncontroverted evidence that establishes traceability for at least one plaintiff, which is all that is required for standing. 12 Specifically, M.P. attends school in Fort Bend ISD (“FBISD”), which dropped its mask mandate by the time trial occurred. Plaintiffs submitted an affidavit by Dennetta Williams, an elected member of FBISD’s Board of Trustees, who attested that “[t]he FBISD mask mandate would remain in place but for [Paxton’s] enforcement of GA-38.” This 9 See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(i)-(iii). 10 Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (emphasis added and cleaned up). 11 Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019). 12 See McAllen Grace Brethren Church v. Salazar, 764 F.3d 465, 471 (5th Cir. 2014) (“It is well settled that once we determine that at least one plaintiff has standing, we need not consider whether the remaining plaintiffs have standing to maintain the suit.”). 23 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 24 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 evidence is sufficient to establish that Paxton’s enforcement efforts were the de facto cause of M.P.’s injury. Moreover, even though five ISDs had not yet lifted their mask mandates on the day of the trial, it was manifestly predictable that they would. Paxton, the State’s highest law enforcement authority, exerted extraordinary pressure on the non-compliant ISDs. As discussed, Paxton sent threatening letters, made threatening tweets, and filed lawsuits against 15 different ISDs to enforce GA-38. The “predictable effect” of Paxton’s enforcement activity was that ISDs would drop their mask mandates. 13 Indeed, as of now, none of the seven ISDs have mask mandates. Based on Williams’ affidavit and the predictable effect of Paxton’s enforcement efforts on non-compliant ISDs, I would affirm the district court’s finding that plaintiffs’ injuries are fairly traceable to Paxton’s conduct. C. To establish the final element of standing, redressability, plaintiffs must show that it is “likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that a favorable decision will redress” their injury. 14 The redressability requirement is met when “a favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury” to the plaintiffs. 15 They “need not show that a favorable decision will relieve [their] every injury.” 16 Plaintiffs satisfied these requirements. 13 Dep’t of Com., 139 S. Ct. at 2566. 14 Dep’t of Texas, Veterans of Foreign Wars of U.S. v. Texas Lottery Comm’n, 760 F.3d 427, 432 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting S. Christian Leadership Conference v. Supreme Court of State of La., 252 F.3d 781, 788 (5th Cir.2001)). 15 Id. (quoting K.P. v. Leblanc, 627 F.3d 115, 123 (5th Cir. 2010)). 16 Id. (emphasis in original). 24 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 25 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 First, plaintiffs sued Attorney General Paxton, the official who was actively enforcing GA-38, to get the relief they required. Also, contrary to what the majority says, plaintiffs do not rely on “speculation” that school districts will impose mask mandates if Paxton is enjoined. Instead, plaintiffs submitted uncontroverted evidence establishing that at least one ISD would immediately reinstate its mask mandate if Paxton is enjoined. In particular, plaintiffs rely on the affidavit by Williams, who attested that “if [Paxton] stopped enforcing GA-38, or there is an order barring enforcement of GA-38, the FBISD mask requirement would immediately go back into effect.” The unchallenged evidence also reflected that all the districts had mask mandates in place when GA-38 issued. The defendant produced no evidence that any of the school districts ever had opposition to the mask mandates in place. It was only after GA-38 issued and Paxton’s enforcement activity began that school districts began yielding to those threats and began lifting their mandates. If this Court affirms the district court’s injunction and holds that Section 504 and Title II required that school districts be allowed to exercise their discretion as to each individual plaintiff and provide an appropriate modification, it is completely predictable that the school districts would comply with the law by imposing some type of mask mandate. GA-38 does not permit the school districts to do this. As the Supreme Court explained in Department of Commerce v. New York, plaintiffs can properly rely on the “predictable effect of government action on the decisions of third parties” as an element of their standing. 17 Based on this evidence, if this Court upholds the injunction against Paxton (which was stayed after three weeks by a motions panel of this 17 139 S. Ct. at 2566; see Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 790–91 (1992) (finding redressability prong satisfied where actors who were not parties to the lawsuit could be expected to amend their conduct in response to a court’s declaration). 25 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 26 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 Court 18), FBISD and the other school districts would likely reimpose their mask mandates as necessary to grant a modification so that plaintiffs could safely attend school with their classmates. As a result, plaintiffs would no longer face the Hobson’s choice of either taking inadequate virtual classes, or attending school without a mask mandate despite the medical advice of their doctors. The district court recognized that ISDs could refuse to impose mask mandates if such mandates “fundamentally alter[ed]” the nature of school programs. 19 But, as the district court correctly noted, Paxton “failed to present any evidence that would support a claim that mask requirements fundamentally alter the educational programs of local school districts.” 20 Paxton had an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of mask mandates—or show the availability of other measures—but he utterly failed to do so. In fact, during the proceedings below, Paxton submitted a single piece of evidence: a mass of raw data showing COVID-19 infection numbers in Texas public schools. He did not even provide an expert opinion to assist the district court or this Court in interpreting the data. Paxton’s decision not to produce evidence should be fatal to his arguments. Thus, on the facts before this Court, federal law obligates ISDs to impose the mask mandates that GA-38 forbids. It is therefore certain, not speculative, that an injunction against Paxton would remedy plaintiffs’ harm. 18 See E.T. v. Paxton, 19 F.4th 760, 763 (5th Cir. 2021). 19 Under the ADA’s implementing regulations, a public entity need not provide a modification, even if it is “reasonable,” when it “fundamentally alters” the nature of the service, program, or activity. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). 20 E.T. v. Morath, No. 1:21-CV-717, 2021 WL 5236553, at *13 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 10, 2021). 26 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 27 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 In sum, the disability discrimination plaintiffs suffered is a sufficient injury. Paxton’s enforcement activity was the de facto cause of this discrimination, and an injunction would remedy the injury. For these reasons, I am satisfied that plaintiffs established each element of standing. 21 III. As to the merits, I would affirm the district court’s injunction to the extent it bars Paxton’s enforcement of GA-38 against plaintiffs’ ISDs and prevents the ISDs from granting even a limited mandate that would allow plaintiffs to attend school. As the district court recognized, Title II and Section 504 and their implementing regulations place an “affirmative obligation” on public entities to make reasonable modifications in their policies and practices when necessary to avoid discrimination because of disability. 22 Texas school districts are subject to Title II and Section 504 as public entities that receive 21 In a Rule 28(j) letter to this Court, defendants cite Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 33 F.4th 1042, 1044 (8th Cir. 2022), in which the Eighth Circuit found that a similar case was moot because of the lessened severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as plaintiffs argue in a different Rule 28(j) letter, the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) continues to recommend that people around vulnerable individuals, like plaintiffs, wear masks. Based on the ongoing nature of the pandemic, and that the CDC continues to recommend masking around vulnerable individuals, this case is not moot. 22 See Bennett-Nelson v. Louisiana Bd. of Regents, 431 F.3d 448, 445-55 (5th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1098 (2006); see also Ridley Sch. Dist. v. M.R., 680 F.3d 260, 281 (3d Cir. 2012) (requiring students to wash their hands before and after meals to protect on student in their classroom with severe food allergies); Alboniga v. School Bd. of Broward Cnty., 87 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1323, 1344-45 (S.D. Fla. 2015) (allowing a service animal to accompany a student with a seizure disorder); K.N. v. Gloucester City Bd. of Educ., 379 F. Supp. 3d 334, 352 (D.N.J. 2019) (providing a one-to-one aide supported by a special education teacher to assist a student with autism). 27 Case: 21-51083 Document: 00516406497 Page: 28 Date Filed: 07/25/2022 No. 21-51083 federal funding. 23 GA-38 bars a school district from imposing even a limited mask requirement and must fall. 24 Plaintiffs established and the district court found from unchallenged evidence that voluntary masking does not adequately protect plaintiffs. There is no basis from this record that vaccination, social distancing, and/or plexiglass can adequately substitute for masking to protect plaintiffs. Uncontradicted evidence supports the district court’s finding that masks are necessary. However, I agree with Paxton that the district court’s injunction is overbroad. An injunction “should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.” 25 Plaintiffs’ injuries would be remedied by a narrow injunction that prohibits Paxton from enforcing GA-38 against the seven ISDs in which plaintiffs attend schools to the extent that GA-38 bars the school districts from granting an accommodation under Section 504 and Title II by requiring some form of mask mandate. The injunction should be limited accordingly. For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the district court’s decision to enjoin Paxton’s enforcement of GA-38. However, because the injunction is overbroad, I would vacate the injunction and remand so that the district court can modify the injunction to bar Paxton from enforcing GA-38 against the seven ISDs plaintiffs attend but limit it to the extent that it precludes school districts the authority to grant a limited mask mandate to allow the 23 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(B); 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(2)(B). 24 See Mary Jo C. v.

Therefore, for these reasons, I respectfully dissent. 29 ","citations":["597 F.3d 74"],"ltree":["federal_supreme","federal_supreme/federal_appeal_11","federal_supreme/federal_appeal_11/federal_district_fl_md"],"generated_summary":"stub","outbound_citations":["42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983"]}
