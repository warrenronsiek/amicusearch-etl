MARTÍNEZ, District Judge. Plaintiff Colorado Rail Passenger Association brings this complaint seeking judicial review of Defendant Federal Transit Administration’s October 17, 20081 final Record of Decision approving the plans to redevelop the transit options at Denver Union Station. Plaintiff alleges that the process underlying the Record of Decision did not comport with the National Environmental Policy Act. This case is before the Court on the merits. For the reasons set forth below, the Court AFFIRMS the Record of Decision. I. STANDARD OF REVIEW Plaintiff brings this action under the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706, which subjects federal agency action to judicial review. Olenhouse v. Commodity Credit Corp., 42 F.3d 1560, 1573 (10th Cir.1994). Under the APA, the Court may “hold unlawful and set aside agency action ... found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law ... [or] in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.... ” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Under the APA, the Court does not review an agency action de novo, but rather sits as an appellate body. Center for Native Ecosystems v. Salazar, 711 F.Supp.2d 1267, 1272 (D.Colo.2010) (citing Olenhouse, 42 F.3d at 1580). An agency action is afforded the presumption of validity; “the burden is on the petitioner to demonstrate that the action is arbitrary and capricious.” Copar Pumice Co., Inc. v. Tidwell, 603 F.3d 780, 793 (10th Cir. 2010). “Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency ‘has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,’ or if the agency action ‘is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.’ ” Id. In determining whether an agency action is arbitrary and capricious, the Court must consider “the full administrative record that was before all decision makers.” Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735, 739 (10th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND This case is about the process underlying redevelopment of Denver Union Station (“DUS”). The process of redeveloping DUS began in 2001 and, for purposes of this action, culminated when the Federal Transit Administration (“FTA” or “Defendant”) issued its Record of Decision (“ROD”) on October 17, 2008. (AR 7985-*11558718.) The Administrative Record in this case contains over 27,000 pages of documents. The following recitation of facts is a brief summary of that seven year process, focusing on the parts of the process that are germane to this action. In 2001, the Regional Transportation District (“RTD”) purchased 19.85 acres of land which includes the DUS building and railway lines on the property. (AR 36.) RTD sought to develop DUS as the multimodal transportation hub of its larger FasTracks program. (AR 8055-8056.) RTD entered into an Intragovern mental Agreement with the City and County of Denver, Colorado Department of Public Transportation, and the Denver Regional Council of Governments (collectively “Partners”) to fund the development of a master plan, a preliminary engineering statement, and any environmental statements necessary. (AR 23847.) In June 2002, FTA notified RTD that federal funding of the DUS project would require the preparation of an environmental impact statement (“EIS”) to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). (AR 236.) To begin this process, FTA published a Notice of Intent to conduct an EIS in the Federal Register on June 4, 2002. 67 Fed.Reg. 38,544 (June 4, 2004) (AR 234-35.) On June 20, 2002, the Partners held both an agency scoping meeting and a public scoping meeting. Key local, state, and federal agencies were invited to the agency scoping meeting; thirteen attended. (AR 8314.) The public scoping meeting was advertised in newspapers of general circulation, posted on the DUS website (www.denverunionstation.org), and sent via e-mail to persons on the project mailing list. (AR 690, 8314.) Over 200 people attended the public scoping meeting. (AR 8314.) At each of these meetings, members from the project team presented an overview of the proposed Master Plan for DUS, explained the EIS process and its projected schedule, and outlined the draft vision and goals for the project. (AR 8314.) This presentation was followed by a question and answer period and a time for public comment. (AR 8314.) Handout materials describing the project were distributed, as well as forms for providing written comments. (AR 8314.) Also at this initial scoping meeting, the Union Station Advisory Committee (“USAC”) was formed. (AR 8315, 10555.) All members of the public at the meeting were invited to participate. As originally composed, USAC had ninety-six members representing thirty-six stakeholder categories. (AR 9574.) The USAC first worked together to compose the vision statement and goals for DUS. (AR 20068, 20093.) The Vision Statement, which remained unchanged throughout the seven year process, follows: DUS will be a multimodal transportation center of international significance and a prominent and distinctive gateway to downtown Denver and the region. The Station will bring critical elements of the public and private local, regional, statewide, and national transportation systems, both existing and future, together with private development and inspiring civic features. DUS will create an exciting setting that will improve the connections between all transportation modes, respect the character and historical significance of the Station and its adjacent neighborhoods, and provide a stimulating environment for public activity and economic vitality. (AR 9290.) USAC met more than twenty times between June 2002 and October 2004, when the initial master plan and zoning was approved by Denver City Council. (AR 9574.) All USAC meetings were open to the public and were adver*1156tised on the project website: www. denverunionstation.org. (AR 691, 17766.) Some USAC meetings were also advertised in newspapers of general circulation and through direct e-mails to persons on project mailing lists. (AR 23166.) Members of the USAC also formed break-out groups according to interests such as rail, traffic, bus, environment, zoning, historic preservation, and land-use issues. (AR 691, 8319-22.) The break-out groups met separately to discuss the issues relevant to them. The break-out groups would then make recommendations to the USAC at various points during the project development process. (Id.) A Technical Advisory Committee (“TAC”) was also formed consisting of representatives of the Partners as well as representatives from transit agencies and companies (e.g., Amtrak, BNSF, Greyhound), environmental agencies (e.g., EPA, Air Quality Council), and other governmental agencies (e.g., Colorado Historical Society, Denver Housing Authority). (AR 8375-8379.) The TAC provided technical guidance and direction to the process of developing alternative design plans and screening those alternatives. (AR 20002-20006.) A second town hall meeting was held on September 12, 2002. (AR 8316.) This meeting was again advertised widely and open to the public. The Partners introduced the project’s proposed purpose and need statement as well as fourteen alternative designs that had been developed by the project team. (AR 8316.) The purpose of the DUS project, as stated in the Final EIS is as follows: The purpose of the proposed project is to enhance the function of DUS as a multimodal transportation center for the Metro Denver Region and the entire State of Colorado. Improving DUS will bring together the various modes of transportation into one place and provide efficient and convenient access to and from downtown Denver. The proposed transportation improvements would help relieve traffic congestion, improve air quality, and provide additional mode options for the traveling public. With an expanded multimodal center, an opportunity exists to provide effective connections between the various transportation modes and services planned to serve DUS. These modal and service connections are expected to improve regional mobility and provide greater access to employment, community services, and other regional destinations. It is also anticipated that improved transit connections to the region will increase transit use due to the variety of services offered, the multiple destinations served, the ease of transfers, and the improved passenger convenience. Without such an expanded multimodal center, current and planned transportation services would be limited in service effectiveness and passenger convenience. DUS would not be able to accommodate the level of transit service needed for the growing region and passengers would be forded to use multiple transfer facilities to make connections. Traffic flow on major downtown streets would be affected, due to bus and rail services having to terminate at multiple downtown locations instead of converging at a central location to distribute passengers. Project transit ridership would likely be lower under a decentralized system, due to reduced passenger convenience and less ease of transfer to reach destinations outside of downtown. The opportunity exists to re-establish DUS’s historic prominence as a full-service transportation hub and reinforce it as a distinctive gateway to downtown Denver, the Metro Denver Region, and the State of Colorado. *1157(AR 8042-45.) Over 150 people attended this second town hall meeting and, based on their comments, nine additional alternative design plans were developed. (AR 8316.) With twenty-three alternative designs proposed for the DUS project, the project team developed a screening process. This process and the criteria encompassed therein were reviewed with the public and the project committees, including the USAC and the TAC. (AR 20247.) The four levels of screening where: (1) fatal flaw analysis; (2) general screening; (3) detailed screening; and (4) additional detailed screening. (AR 20240, 23307-312.) The project team allocated each of the twenty-three alternatives into one of five groups (lettered A-E) according to common characteristics such as placement of rail and light rail tracks below ground or at-grade or the location of the commercial bus terminal. (AR 4128-36.) These alternatives then progressed through a four-step screening process at USAC meetings over the next two years. A description of the process and its results follows: • Tier I (fatal flaw analysis): Sketch-level engineering drawings and cross-sections of each alternative were prepared for public review and discussion. (AR 20355.) These drawings were screened for safety-related issues and irreconcilable conflicts between proposed transit and existing transit (principally automobile traffic). (AR 362, 20273-74.) After public discussion, eight alternatives were eliminated during the fatal flaw analysis. (AR 4137.) • Tier II (general screening): Refinements were made to the engineering drawings and cross-sections as necessary to consider the following criteria2: their ability to provide anticipated operational capacity, connectivity between modes of transportation, private development potential, and efficient use of the DUS building. (AR 4137-39.) After public discussion, six alternatives were eliminated during the general screening process. (AR 4137.) • Tier III (detailed screening): The detailed screening process involved transportation effectiveness, impact on the existing transportation system, financial viability, historic preservation, impact on the natural and build environment, urban design and neighborhood integration, and constructability. (AR 20248.) Three alternatives were eliminated during the detailed screening process, primarily for poor connectivity and constructability issues. (AR 4133-37.) • Tier IV (additional detailed screening): At step four of the screening process, the remaining six alternatives were put into three groups based on similarities in the configuration of their primary transit operations (light rail, passenger rail, and commercial bus service). (AR 4129-35.) The two alternatives in each group were re-evaluated based on the criteria used in the detailed screening process with the addition of walk distances, flexibility, and access between all transportation modes. (AR 4131-35.) The alternative that faired better in these categories advanced while the other alternative was eliminated. (AR 4137.) Following completion of the screening process, three alternatives remained. Alternative A2 placed both light rail and passenger rail at-grade. (AR 4129.) Alternative C3 placed passenger rail at-grade and light rail underground. (AR *11584131.) Alternative E2 placed both passenger rail and light rail underground. (AR 4134.) More detailed engineering studies were conducted as to each of these options and more detailed drawings were made. (AR 10253.) The final three alternatives were then evaluated on the following criteria: transportation operations and accommodations, connection and transfers between major modes, opportunities for private development, historic preservation, traffic impacts, impacts to built environment, urban design and neighborhood integration, constructability and phasing of major modes, parking and service, additional carriers, mall shuttle/additional downtown circulator, and cost/revenue. (AR 20473.) Input on the final three alternatives was sought from USAC, TAC, and other involved agencies. (AR 20358; 20403.) Additionally, the three remaining alternatives were also presented to the public at the third town hall meeting, held in January 2004. (AR 8317.) Following all of these meetings, Alternative A2 was ultimately eliminated because it required at-grade crossings on Wewatta Street, which was deemed unacceptable due to the traffic impacts. (AR 20493.) Though both Alternative E2 and C3 were acceptable, Alternative E2 was preferred because C3 had a stub-end station for light rail while E2 allowed for a through station. (AR 20353.) Thus, Alternative E2 was identified as the preferred option for DUS. (AR 4156.) The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (“DEIS”) was published in March 2006. (AR 4017.) It considered the environmental impacts of taking no action on the DUS site (“No Action Alternative”) and Alternative E2, referred to as the “Vision Plan Alternative” in the DEIS. (AR 4020.) When fully implemented, the Vision Plan Alternative would have placed light rail, passenger rail, and regional bus facilities underground at DUS. (AR 4147.) Due to financial constraints, however, the DEIS divided the Vision Plan Alternative into subparts and placed greater emphasis on “Phase I” of the Vision Plan Alternative. (AR 4151-56.) Phase I included construction of a below-grade light rail station comprised of three tracks and platforms, enhancing the at-grade passenger rail service, relocating the 16th Street Mall Shuttle turn-around, and other related site improvements. (AR 4020.) The 45-day public review period for the DEIS was from March 24, 2006 through May 8, 2006. A public hearing on the DEIS was held on April 19, 2006. (AR 4020, 4648, 8317.) After the DEIS was published, two major set-backs to implementation of the Vision Plan occurred. First, the railroads informed RTD that they would not allow light rail vehicles to operate within their rights-of-way. RTD has planned for the Gold Line, which was being developed to serve the transportation corridor from Arvada to DUS, to utilize light rail technology within the railroads rights-of-way. (AR 5123.) The railroads’ reversal on light rail access forced RTD to change the Gold Line to commuter rail rather than light rail. This change, in turn, forced reconsideration of the Vision Plan Alternative. It diminished the number of light rail lines and increased the number of passenger rail lines necessary for proper operation. (AR 24003-29.) Additionally, because the Gold Line was the only light rail planned to access DUS from the north, it was no longer necessary for the light rail to be accessible from that direction. (Id.) Another set back to implementation of the Vision Alternative occurred in fall 2007. On October 11, 2007, for the first time, the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) expressed safety concerns with a below-grade passenger rail station. (AR *11596063.) Full implementation of the Vision Plan Alternative would have put all passenger rail lines below-grade. (AR 4147.) Because FRA would not allow passenger trains to use a below-grade station, it was clear that the Vision Plan evaluated in the DEIS would have to be substantially revamped. (AR 15049-50, 15128.) Specifically, the project team had to devise an alternative that kept the rail components at-grade while still meeting the purpose and need of the project. After significant discussion, the project team arrived at a final plan that would accommodate FRA’s safety concerns and the railroad’s right-of-way issues while still fulfilling the purpose and need of the DUS project. (AR 6186.) It featured eight commuter rail tracks at-grade next to DUS, a regional bus facility below grade under 17th Street, and two light rail tracks and a light rail station adjacent to the Consolidated Main Line (primarily used for freight hauling trains) two blocks away at the end of 17th Street. (AR 6186.) This new plan is referred to as the “Build Alternative”. (AR 8050.) FTA and RTD jointly issued a Final Environmental Impact Statement (“FEIS”) on August 15, 2008. (AR 6554-7190.) The FEIS compared the environmental impacts of the No Action Alternative, the Phase I Alternative3, and the Build Alternative. (AR 8052-71.) The FEIS designated the Build Alternative as the preferred option. (AR 7987.) The public comment period for the FEIS ran from July 11, 2008 until August 25, 2008 and a public hearing was held on September 10, 2008. (AR 7987, 8318, 9398.) FTA approved the FEIS in a Record of Decision (“ROD”) dated October 17, 2008. (AR 10251-65.) The ROD reviewed the process FTA, RTD, and the other entities involved had undertaken to arrive at the Build Alternative as the preferred option and found that the process had satisfied the applicable requirements under NEPA. (AR 10251.) Plaintiff filed this action on May 18, 2009 alleging that the process by which the Build Alternative was selected for the DUS development violated NEPA. The case was briefed by the parties on its merits. (ECF Nos. 32, 41, 49, 68 and 83.) The Court also allowed RTD, the City and County of Denver, and the Colorado Department of Transportation to file amicus briefs. (ECF Nos. 39, 40, and 48.) All interested parties having been afforded the opportunity to be heard, the case is ripe for review by this Court. III. ANALYSIS In the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”), Congress specifically “recogniz[ed] the profound impact of man’s activity on the interrelations of all components of the natural environment,” and resolved “to recreate and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.” 42 U.S.C. § 4331. “These sweeping goals have inspired some commentators to call NEPA an environmentalist Magna Carta.” Citizens Against Burlington, Inc. v. Busey, 938 F.2d 190, 193 (D.C.Cir.1991). “NEPA commands agencies to imbue their decisionmaking, through the use of certain procedures, with our country’s commitment to environmental salubrity.” Id. at 193-194. Under NEPA, “major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” must be preceded *1160by an EIS. 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). The EIS requirement serves two important functions: “It ensures that the agency, in reaching its decision, will have available, and will carefully consider, detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts; it also guarantees that the relevant information will be made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decisionmaking process and the implementation of that decision.” Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989). NEPA specifies five specific issues which must be addressed in the EIS: (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action, (ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented, (iii) alternatives to the proposed action, (iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and (v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented. 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). Thus, “through a set of ‘action-forcing’ procedures” NEPA requires agencies to take a “hard look” at the environmental consequences of proposed actions. Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350, 109 S.Ct. 1835. The Court reviews an agency’s NEPA process under the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. Citizens Against Burlington, 938 F.2d at 194. As the Supreme Court has observed, “once an agency has made a decision subject to NEPA’s procedural requirements, the only role for a court is to insure that the agency has considered the environmental consequences”. Strycker’s Bay Neighborhood Council, Inc. v. Karlen, 444 U.S. 223, 227-28, 100 S.Ct. 497, 62 L.Ed.2d 433 (1980) (per curiam) (citation and quotation omitted). The Tenth Circuit has held that the district court’s objective in reviewing an EIS “is not to ‘fly speck’ the environmental impact statement, but rather, to make a pragmatic judgment whether the environmental impact statement’s form, content and preparation foster both informed decision-making and informed public participation.” Custer Cty. Action Assoc. v. Garvey, 256 F.3d 1024, 1035 (10th Cir. 2001). The Court is to apply “a rule of reason standard (essentially an abuse of discretion standard) in deciding whether claimed deficiencies in a FEIS are merely flyspecks, or are significant enough to defeat [NEPA’s] goals of informed decision making and informed public comment.” Fuel Safe Washington v. F.E.R.C., 389 F.3d 1313, 1323 (10th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted). Plaintiffs arguments against FTA’s Record of Decision essentially boil down to four points: (1) the DEIS and FEIS prepared in this case were flawed due to a conflict of interest on the part of a preparer; (2) FTA improperly limited the scope of the FEIS by failing to include connected action and failing to fully consider the cumulative effect of the project; (3) FTA failed to consider all reasonable alternatives; and (4) FTA failed to comply with Section 4(f)’s requirements. The Court will consider each of these arguments in turn below. A. Conflict of Interest Plaintiff alleges that the FTA violated NEPA because the contractor it chose to prepare the EIS had a conflict of interest that compromised the integrity of the NEPA process. (ECF No. 34 at 8-13.) Federal regulations provide that a project’s EIS should be “prepared directly by *1161or by a contractor selected by the lead agency or ... a cooperating agency.” 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(c). If a contractor is hired, it is required to execute a disclosure statement specifying that it has “no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project.” Id. In choosing a contractor, the agency should avoid any conflicts of interest. Id.; see also Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ’s National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (“Forty Questions”), 46 Fed.Reg. 18,026, 18,031 (Council on Envtl. Quality 1981) (stating that a contractor with a conflict of interest “should be disqualified from preparing the EIS.”). Whether a contractor has a conflict of interest hinges on the definition of “financial or other interest” in Section 1506.5(c). The Tenth Circuit has observed that this phrase “has eluded precise definition.” Associations Working for Aurora’s Residential Environment (“AWARE”) v. Colorado Dept. of Trans., 153 F.3d 1122, 1127 (10th Cir.1998) (hereafter “AWARE”). Generally, “absent an agreement to perform construction on the proposed project or actual ownership of the construction site, it is ‘doubtful that an inherent conflict of interest will exist’ unless ‘the contract for EIS preparation ... contains ... incentive clauses or guarantees of any future work on the project.’ ” Id. at 1127 (quoting Guidance Regarding NEPA Regulations, 48 Fed.Reg. 34,263, 34,266 (Council on Envtl. Quality 1983)). The issue here is whether the contractor that prepared the EIS in this case had a conflict of interest that should have disqualified it from participating in the process. In this case, RTD originally contracted with Parsons Brinkerhoff and Jones Lang LaSalle d/b/a Union Station Alianee to conduct an Environmental Assessment.4 (AR 11743.) FTA informed RTD that it would prefer that a full environment impact statement be prepared for the DUS project. (AR 240.) RTD modified its contract with the Union Station Alianee accordingly. (AR 12130-32.) Plaintiff does not argue that the Union Station Alianee had a conflict of interest. Rather, Plaintiff focuses on a different company, Jacobs, Carter & Burgess (“Jacobs”). In 2005, RTD contracted with Jacobs to serve as the Project Management Consultant (PMC) on its overall FasTracks project. (AR 13466.) Redevelopment of DUS is a central part of the FasTracks project and, therefore, one of the tasks given to Jacobs as PMC was to coordinate and review the environmental impact statements for DUS. (AR 12734, 12807.) Gina McMee is the employee at Jacobs that was tasked with that duty; she is named in the FEIS as the “RTD FasTracks EIS Manager”. (AR 8334.) McMee was not actually employed by RTD; she served as an adjunct of the RTD staff but was employed by Jacobs. (AR 13995,17763.) Plaintiff argues that the FEIS is tainted by a conflict of interest because Jacobs, as a project manager for the overall FasTracks program, had an economic interest in encouraging selection of the Build Aternative as the preferred option. Plaintiff contends that this conflict of interest compromised the NEPA process because it resulted in the FasTracks components of the plan, specifically the Build Aternative, being favored over the No Action Aternative or proposed alternatives *1162that emphasized other transportation options over FasTracks components. (ECF No. 32 at 11.) However, Plaintiff has cited nothing in the record showing that Jacobs had a financial incentive to manipulate the DUS EIS process. Jacobs’s contract with RTD included a conflict of interest provision that prohibited Jacobs from “performing] any new or follow-on work for corridor DEIS/FEIS, Preliminary Engineering, Final Design, Construction, or Design/Build contract.” (AR 12466-67.) While there was certainly overlap between FasTracks and the DUS EIS in that how FasTracks would be implemented depended, in part, on how the passenger rail and light rail tracks would be aligned at DUS. However, Plaintiff has failed to point out any incentive clauses or guarantees of future work in Jacobs’s contract that would have been significantly impacted by the results of the EIS process. As such, Plaintiff has failed to establish a conflict of interest that violated § 1506.5(c).5 See Northern Crawfish Frog v. Federal Highway Admin. 858 F.Supp. 1503, 1529 (D.Kan.1994) (where engineering firm was merely a participant in the preparation of the EIS and had no incentives or guarantee of future work, there was no conflict of interest). Plaintiff also argues that Jacobs, through McAfee, “essentially assumed primary responsibility for preparation of the DU DEIS/FEIS NEPA documents.” (ECF No. 68 at 17.) However, it fails to cite any factual or legal support for this argument. As the chief applicant for federal funds in this case, RTD had a duty to oversee the EIS process. 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(c). That duty was primarily delegated to McAfee in this case. The record shows that McAfee had an administrative oversight role in the EIS process but there is no indication that she dominated the process. In the FEIS, she was merely one of sixty-eight consultants and “supplemental preparers” listed. (AR 8334.) Even assuming that Jacobs had a conflict of interest, and that such conflict of interest was imputed to McAfee, one cannot reasonably conclude that the fact that one person amongst sixty-eight overseeing the EIS process had a possible conflict of interest impermissibly tainted the entire process. Additionally, the Court finds that, even if there was a conflict of interest, FTA exercised sufficient control over the process such that the integrity of the NEPA process was not compromised. *1163“When reviewing an EIS prepared by a contractor who has allegedly breached a requirement imposed by 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(c), the ultimate question for the court is ... whether the alleged breach compromised the objectivity and integrity of the NEPA process.” AWARE, 153 F.3d at 1129 (quotation and citation omitted). The Tenth Circuit has held that the Court “can evaluate the oversight that the agency provided to the environmental impact statement process as a factual matter and make a determination upholding the environmental impact statement.” Id. Not every violation of the NEPA regulations warrants reversal of an agency determination. Id. n. 8 (late filed conflict disclosure that violated the NEPA regulations did not warrant reversal when agency exercised sufficient oversight of the process); Citizens Against Burlington, 938 F.2d at 202 (NEPA violation did not warrant reversal when the error did not “compromise the objectivity and integrity of the NEPA process”). Having reviewed the portions of the record cited by the parties, the Court finds that, to the extent there was a conflict of interest, it did not compromise the integrity of the NEPA process. The FTA was intimately involved with the NEPA process from the beginning to the end. RTD originally envisioned preparation of an environmental assessment rather than an environmental impact statement. However, at FTA’s insistence, RTD adjusted its plan and prepared a more detailed and comprehensive environmental impact statement. (AR 236-37.) After the DEIS had been published, the FTA was involved in reviewing the public comments and provided meaningful responses and substantive input. (AR 2603-23.) The FTA reviewed a draft of the FEIS prior to it being issued and again provided substantive comments. (AR 10838-59.) Further evidence of FTA’s active involvement with the EIS process is the fact that it issued substantive opinions on issues that arose during the EIS process, such as a letter to the Colorado State Historic Preservation Officer outlining how the Union Station Project was independent from the surrounding private development for purposes of the EIS. (AR 6455-62.) Because the FTA exercised sufficient oversight throughout the process, any conflict of interest on the part of Jacobs did not impermissibly compromise the NEPA process in this case. See Brandon v. Pierce, 725 F.2d 555, 564 (10th Cir.1984) (overlooking conflict of interest when agency “substantially carried out its [NEPA] duties by making the ultimate decision and giving the required notice of that decision.”). B. Scope of the EIS Plaintiff next argues that the FTA violated NEPA because it failed to include the private development surrounding DUS within the scope of the EIS. (ECF No. 34 at 13-15.) Federal regulations require an agency to consider all “connected” actions in the same EIS. 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25(a). An EIS must also consider the cumulative effect of all past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25; 40 C.F.R. § 1508.7. “The purpose of this requirement is to prevent an agency from dividing a project into multiple actions, each of which individually has insignificant environmental impact, but which collectively have a substantial impact.” Wilderness Workshop v. United States Bureau of Land Mgmt., 531 F.3d 1220, 1229 (10th Cir.2008). 1. Connected Actions Federal regulations define “connected” actions as follows: Connected actions, which means that they are closely related and therefore should be discussed in the same impact *1164statement. Actions are connected if they: (i) Automatically trigger other actions which may require environmental impact statements. (ii) Cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously. (iii) Are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification. 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25(a)(1). During the EIS process, FTA made an explicit finding that the federally-funded transportation development at DUS was not “connected” to the surrounding private development. (AR 6460-61, 8262.) The FTA’s finding was based on its conclusion that the private development: (1) did not depend on the DUS transportation improvements; (2) did not affect the selection of the Build Alternative as the preferred option; (3) will be paid for by private funds; and (4) did not utilize federal funds or require federal approval. (AR 8262.) “When called upon to review factual determinations made by an agency as part of its NEPA process, short of a ‘clear error of judgment’ we ask only whether the agency took a ‘hard look’ at information relevant to the decision.” New Mexico ex rel. Richardson, 565 F.3d 683, 704 (10th Cir.2009). As discussed below, the Court finds that FTA took a hard look at the evidence in the record before finding that the private development was not connected to the DUS project. There is no dispute as to the evidentiary support in the record for FTA’s third and fourth findings regarding funding of the private development. The record shows, and Plaintiff admits, that the private developments will be funded solely with private funds. (AR 15077-92; ECF No. 68 at 32.) There is no contention that any of the private development required will utilize federal funds or that it required federal approval. Plaintiff instead argues that the private development is connected with the DUS project because implementation of the Build Alternative will spur additional private development. (ECF No. 38 at 60.) Even assuming this is true, a federally-funded project is not “connected” to another, privately-funded action, simply because it makes future development more likely. See Wilderness Workshop, 531 F.3d at 1231 (“Under the applicable definition of connected action, the fact that the existence of a pipeline may encourage additional gas wells, and probably will serve additional gas wells, does not mean necessarily that additional wells are connected actions.”). Plaintiff also argues that the value of the land surrounding Union Station will be increased by implementation of the Build Alternative and, therefore, the private development is a connected action. (ECF No. 68 at 32.) The Court does not doubt that improving and expanding transportation options at DUS may increase the value of the surrounding land. But it fails to see how the fact that land value will increase around the project shows that it is “connected” to the private development. NEPA is a statute protecting environmental policy and environmental issues; an agency is not required to consider purely economic effects in its EIS. Coliseum Square Ass’n v. Jackson, 465 F.3d 215, 234 (5th Cir.2006) (“NEPA does not require such an examination of ‘purely economic’ impacts.”). Thus, the fact that the Build Alternative may impact the value of the private development does not make them connected actions. There is also sufficient evidence in the record supporting the FTA’s finding that the private development did not affect the selection of the Build Alternative as the preferred option. Although one of the *1165general screening criteria was “[o]pportunities for private development, including the amount of potential at-grade development sites with street frontage” (AR 4125), private development was mentioned as a basis for eliminating only two proposed alternative plans. (AR 4138-39.) Alternative A1 was eliminated “due to poor operational capacity, poor connectivity, lack of future expansion capacity, and limited development potential along Wewatta Street.” (AR 4138.) Public Submittal Number 1 was eliminated “due to poor transportation phasing flexibility, poor pedestrian permeability and connectivity on site, and poor potential for joint development and integration of retail uses along Wewatta Street.” (AR 4139.) Because the lack of potential for private development was but one factor in the decision to eliminate them from consideration, it was not an abuse of discretion for the FTA to find that the potential for private development did not impact the selection of the Build Alternative as the preferred option. Finally, the record shows that the FTA took a hard look at the evidence before finding that the private development was not dependent on the selection of the Build Alternative as the preferred option. Plaintiff contends that “most of the private development will not proceed unless the associated DUS development takes place.” (ECF No. 68 at 26.) However, Plaintiff fails to support this contention with any citation to the record and, in fact, the record is replete with evidence to the contrary. The Metro Vision 2030 Plan shows that the Denver metropolitan area has been one of the fastest-growing regions in the country over the last fifteen years. (AR 1196.) Forecasts show that its population is expected to grow by over a million people by 2030. (AR 1208; AR 6458.) To accommodate this anticipated population increase, the Metro Vision Plan encourages infill and redevelopment of underutilized areas in the urban core. (AR 1207.) In furtherance of this plan, the City and County of Denver changed its zoning around DUS in 2004 to encourage mixed-use development. (Amicus Brief of City and County of Denver (ECF No. 40) at 8-9.) At the time the FEIS was prepared, which was necessarily before the ROD was issued, more than 3,500 housing units had been built, planned, permitted or were under construction in the vicinity of DUS. (AR 8258.) Thus, there is no support for Plaintiffs contention that the private development surrounding Union Station would not have occurred but for selection of the Build Alternative. Rather, there is more than sufficient evidence in the record to support FTA’s finding that the private development would have occurred regardless of which option was chosen during the DUS EIS process. In sum, the Court finds that the FTA took a hard look at the evidence in the record before determining that the private development surrounding Union Station was not “connected” to the project for purposes of 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25(a)(1). As such, the Court has no reason to conclude that this finding was erroneous. Forest Guardians v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife, 611 F.3d 692, 711 (10th Cir.2010). Additionally, the Tenth Circuit has held that “projects that have ‘independent utility’ are not ‘connected actions’ under 40 C.F.R. 1508.25(a)(l)(iii).”6 Custer Cty. Ac*1166tion Assoc., 256 F.3d at 1037. “The crux of the [independent utility] test is whether each of the two projects would have taken place with or without the other and thus had independent utility.” Wilderness Workshop, 531 F.3d at 1229; see also Utahns for a Better Transportation v. United States Dept. of Trans., 305 F.3d 1152, 1183 (10th Cir.2002) (“An inquiry into independent utility reveals whether the project is indeed a separate project, justifying the consideration of the environmental effects of that project alone.”) FTA argues that the DUS project and the surrounding private development have independent utility. The Court agrees. The Build Alternative serves the purpose of increasing transportation options for the downtown Denver area regardless of whether the private development was built. On the other hand, the private development has the independent utility of infilling a previously underutilized part of the downtown Denver district. While much of the private development was designed to take advantage of the increased transportation options in the Build Alternative, the fact that the transportation elements of the DUS project and the surrounding private development are mutually beneficial does not make them connected per se. See id.; San Juan Citizens’ Alliance v. Salazar, 2009 WL 824410, *12 (D.Colo. March 30, 2009) (“where administrative record showed that new development would have occurred regardless of the federally-funded project, actions were not connected”). Accordingly, the Court finds that FTA’s failure to consider the private development surrounding DUS as a connected action was not an abuse of discretion. 2. Cumulative Effects Even where an agency is not required to analyze the full impact of another project, the agency “must still adequately analyze the cumulative effects of the project within each individual EIS.” Earth Island Institute v. United States Forest Service, 351 F.3d 1291, 1306 (9th Cir.2003). Cumulative effects are defined as: the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time. 40 C.F.R. 1508.7. In this circuit, the test for whether particular actions are cumulative is “whether the actions were so interdependent that it would be unwise or irrational to complete one without the others.” Airport Neighbors Alliance, Inc. v. United States, 90 F.3d 426, 430 (10th Cir.1996) (citing Park Cty. Resource Council, Inc. v. United States Dep’t of Agric., 817 F.2d 609 (10th Cir.1987)). In a section entitled “Secondary and Cumulative Effects”, the FEIS discusses the combined impact of the Build Alternative and the proposed private residential and commercial development on the following categories: social environment, parks and public facilities, public safety and security, utilities, energy, air quality, and water resources and quality. (AR 8261-70.) Plaintiff recognizes that the FTA considered these issues but argues that this was not sufficient to constitute a “hard look” because the FTA failed to consider the cumulative effects of private development on the “construction and post-construction vehicular traffic, historic resources, noise, and visual resources.” (ECF No. 68 at 27.) “NEPA does not require that an agency discuss every impact in great detail, it simply requires a reasoned evalúa*1167tion of the relevant factors.” Forest Guardians v. United States Forest Serv., 495 F.3d 1162, 1172 (10th Cir.2007). The Court’s role in reviewing an EIS is “not to question the wisdom of the agency’s ultimate decision or its conclusion concerning the magnitude of indirect cumulative impacts.” Fuel Safe Washington v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 389 F.3d 1313, 1331 (10th Cir.2004). Rather, the Court is to “examine the administrative record, as a whole, to determine whether the [agency] made a reasonable, good faith, objective presentation of those impacts sufficient to foster public participation and informed decision making.” Colo. Envtl. Coalition v. Dombeck, 185 F.3d 1162, 1176 (10th Cir.1999). Having reviewed the relevant parts of the record, the Court finds that the FTA presented the cumulative effects of the proposed private development surrounding Union Station in a reasonable and good faith manner that would allow the public to make educated, informed comments and the agency to make an informed decision. NEPA requires no more. Forest Guardians, 495 F.3d at 1172. C. Consideration of Alternatives NEPA requires that an EIS contain a “detailed statement” about “alternatives to the proposed action.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). The regulations describe the discussion of alternatives as “the heart of the environmental impact statement.” 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14 (1986). The Tenth Circuit has held that it is “absolutely essential to the NEPA process that the decisionmaker be provided with a detailed and careful analysis of the relative environmental merits and demerits of the proposed action and possible alternatives, a requirement that we have characterized as the linchpin of the entire impact statement.” All Indian Pueblo Council v. U.S., 975 F.2d 1437, 1444 (10th Cir.1992) (emphasis in original). In addressing alternatives to a proposed action in an EIS, federal agencies must “Vigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives, and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed study, briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated.” 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(a) (1986). As to the reasonable alternatives, the agency must provide sufficient detail “to permit a reasoned choice of alternatives as far as environmental aspects are concerned.” All Indian Pueblo Council, 975 F.2d at 1445. However, NEPA does not require agencies to analyze “the environmental consequences of alternatives it has in good faith rejected as too remote, speculative, or ... impractical or ineffective.” City of Aurora v. Hunt, 749 F.2d 1457, 1467 (10th Cir.1984); see also Holy Cross Wilderness Fund v. Madigan, 960 F.2d 1515, 1528 (10th Cir.1992) (agency did not err in rejecting alternative that was “too speculative and dependent upon too many uncertainties.”); Airport Neighbors Alliance, 90 F.3d 426, 432 (10th Cir.1996) (agency properly denied consideration of alternative that required removal of existing facilities and was too costly). Although over twenty alternatives were submitted during the planning process and an additional twenty were developed in response to comments and suggestions, the EIS here considered in detail the environmental impacts of only the No Action Alternative, Build Alternative, and the Phase I Alternative of the Vision Plan. (AR 4144^156; 7897; 8022-8028.) It includes a detailed explanation of the components of each of these options, how these options would be implemented, detailed engineering drawings, and aerial photographs. (AR 4144-4156.) The DEIS then considers the relative environmental impacts of each of these alternatives. It *1168examines and compares the impact each alternative would have on the following categories: land use, interplay with regional transportation plans, parks, trails, and public recreation, public safety and security, visual quality and aesthetics, cultural resources, economics, utilities, energy, air quality, noise and vibration, geology, water resources and quality, biological resources, and hazardous materials. (AR 4158-4226.) All other alternatives were discussed only briefly with a short explanation of why they had been eliminated during the screening process. (AR 4129-36.) Plaintiff argues that this violated NEPA because the FTA impermissibly failed to consider a number of other alternatives that were reasonable. (ECF No. 34 at 25-33.) However, Plaintiff fails to cite a specific alternative that should have been considered in more detail. Rather, Plaintiff argues that reasonable alternatives would have included an on-site commercial bus facility and room for possible expansion of passenger rail. (Id.) The record shows that both an on-site commercial bus station and the possibility of expansion of passenger rail were discussed repeatedly throughout the development process. The commercial bus carrier in Denver — Greyhound—was intimately involved in the planning process but ultimately opted to keep its operations based out of its current location rather than relocate services to DUS. (AR 21761.) Greyhound informed the planning committee that the estimated expense of moving its operations was too high. (Id.) The passenger rail community also was extensively involved with the planning process. Ultimately, however, expansion of rail travel was not made a priority because there is no funding for it. As RTD noted in a letter in the administrative record: “There is no entity in Colorado with the legal authority to finance, construct or operate a front-range commuter rail serve beyond the bounds of the RTD and no funding in place to acquire right of way or cars for any such service.” (AR 15049.) An agency is not required to consider every possibility or every desire in an EIS; rather, it is only required to consider reasonable alternatives. Both expansion of passenger rail travel and an on-site commercial bus terminal were thoroughly explored during the planning and screening process. Given the lack of current funding and the uncertainty of any future funding, it was not an abuse of discretion to eliminate alternatives that included an on-site commercial bus facility or the expansion of passenger rail travel. See Holy Cross Wilderness Fund v. Madigan, 960 F.2d 1515, 1528 (10th Cir.1992) (agency did not err in rejecting alternative that was “too speculative and dependent upon too many uncertainties.”); Seacoast Anti-Pollution League v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 598 F.2d 1221, 1222-23 (1st Cir.1979) (agency not required to consider alternative that was “wholly theoretical”); Prairie Band of Pottawatomie Nation v. Federal Highway Administration, 751 F.Supp.2d 1174, 1195 (D.Kan.2010) (where FHWA “reasonably and in good faith concluded” that alternative “was too impractical or ineffective with respect to the project’s purpose and need”, failure to consider that alternative did not violate NEPA). Plaintiff also argues generally that the EIS failed to give adequate reasons for eliminating various alternatives. NEPA requires only that FTA provide a good faith basis for why an agency decided that an alternative was not reasonable and did not merit further consideration. Hunt, 749 F.2d at 1467 (NEPA satisfied when agency provided reasonable explanation for why alternatives were rejected); All Indian Pueblo, 975 F.2d at 1445 (where *1169EIS showed that the agency considered an alternative and gave plausible reasons for why it was rejected, the agency has adequately considered such alternative for purposes of NEPA). Here, the DEIS includes a discussion of all of the alternatives that were proposed during the screening process. (AR 4129-36.) It explains the four-tier screening process that was used to identify which of the proposed alternatives merited further consideration. (AR 4123.) The DEIS then explains how each tier was implemented, which alternatives were rejected at each step, and on what basis each alternative was rejected. (AR 4138-40.) The reasons for excluding the rejected alternatives are reasonable; they range from failure to satisfy the minimum passenger carrying capacity requirements to space constraints to poor connectivity between transportation modes. (Id.) Thus, the Court finds that FTA has provided a good faith explanation for why each of the non-chosen alternatives was rejected and has thereby satisfied NEPA in this respect. Finally, Plaintiff argues that selection of the Build Alternative was itself arbitrary and capricious because the Build Alternative does not satisfy the purpose and needs of the project. This appears to be an argument that FTA made the wrong choice for its preferred option. The Court understands that Plaintiff, as a passenger rail association, wishes that the preferred option had placed greater emphasis on the expansion of rail travel. However, the law is perfectly clear that NEPA is not results-oriented; it is process-oriented. Under NEPA, the Court does not determine whether an agency arrived at the right result through its EIS process. Rather, the Court determines only whether the agency followed the right process. Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350, 109 S.Ct. 1835 (“it is now well settled that NEPA itself does not mandate particular results, but simply prescribes the necessary process.”); see also Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Andrus, 619 F.2d 1368, 1374 (10th Cir. 1980) (explaining that the “requirements of NEPA ... apply to procedure and do not undertake to control decision making”). The DUS project went through an extensive planning process. Public meetings were held on a regular basis to discuss all aspects of the project. The alternatives were presented to the public, discussed at public meetings, and ultimately eliminated at public meetings. The entire process used to select the Build Alternative as the preferred option was transparent and was subjected to intense public scrutiny. Ultimately, FTA had the discretion to determine which alternative best satisfied the purpose and needs of the project. So long as it took a hard look at the possible options and legitimately assessed their relative values before selecting the preferred option, it has satisfied its NEPA obligations. Dubois v. United States Dept. of Agriculture, 102 F.3d 1273, 1289 (1st Cir. 1996) (“The agency has discretion to balance competing concerns and to choose among alternatives, but it must legitimately assess the relative merits of reasonable alternatives before making its decision.”). The Court finds that the process undertaken here has satisfied NEPA. Utahns for Better Transp., 305 F.3d at 1163 (court’s role in reviewing NEPA action is to ensure that process was sufficient to satisfy NEPA’s “goals of informed decisionmaking and informed public comment.”). D. Standing to Pursue Section 4(f) Claims Plaintiff contends that the EIS process failed to comply with Section 4(f)7 of the *1170Department of Transportation Act of 1966 by failing to consider alternatives that would have had less impact on the historic nature of DUS. (ECF No. 34 at 46-50.) FTA responds by raising the issue of whether Plaintiff has standing to pursue a claim under Section 4(f). (ECF No. 41 at 75.) There are two aspects of standing under the APA, strict Article III standing and the judicially created doctrine of prudential standing. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (standing inquiry involves constitutional limitations on federal court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise). To satisfy the requirement of prudential standing, a party seeking review of an agency determination under the APA must show that it has “suffered] a legal wrong” or been “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute”. 5 U.S.C. § '702. The Supreme Court has held that to be “adversely affected or aggrieved ... within the meaning of a relevant statute” for purposes of Section 702, a plaintiff “must establish that the injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the adverse effect upon him) falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint.” Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 883, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990). Another layer to the issue of standing in this case is that Plaintiff in this lawsuit is an organization. An organization has representational standing when (1) at least one of its members would have standing to sue in his own right; (2) the organization seeks to protect interests germane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief sought requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. See Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). To examine standing in this case, the Court must first determine what interest Plaintiff seeks to protect in pursuing its Section 4(f) claim. Plaintiffs Section 4(f) claim implicates two statutes, the National Historic Places Act (“NHPA”) and the Department of Transportation Act (“DOTA”). Under Section 4(f) of DOTA, 49 U.S.C. § 303(c), federal funding of a transportation project that adversely effects a historic site cannot be approved unless the agency shows that there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of the site and that it has done all possible planning to minimize harm to the site. Similarly, the NHPA requires that any federally funded undertaking “take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register” of Historic Places. See 16 U.S.C. § 470f. At the heart of both of these statutes is protection of historic places and the need to consider the historic nature of a place in evaluating alternatives within the NEPA framework. To establish organizational standing, Plaintiff must show that “the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose.” Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434. “The burden is on the party seeking review under § 702 to set forth specific facts (even though they may be controverted by the Government) showing that he has satisfied its terms.” Lujan, 497 U.S. at 883, 110 S.Ct. 3177. Plaintiff is an organization that “works to develop, preserve and improve passenger rail services in and through the State of Colorado and the nation. [Plaintiff] supports efforts to provide multi-modal solutions to Colorado’s growing transportation problems. [Plaintiff] believes *1171that passenger rail in some of the state’s busiest corridors can provide a mobility choice for travelers who either cannot or do not wish to drive.” (Compl. ¶ 2.) Nothing in the record shows that protecting the historical nature of Union Station falls within the zone of interests of Plaintiff or any of its members. Because Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing standing and has failed to do so, the Court finds that Plaintiff lacks standing to raise a challenge under Section 4(f) of DOTA or the NHPA. Lujan, 497 U.S. at 883, 110 S.Ct. 3177. E. Need to Prepare Supplemental EIS For the first time in its reply brief, Plaintiff argues that FTA violated federal law by changing the preferred option between the DEIS and FEIS. Federal regulations provide that an agency “[s]hall prepare supplements to either draft of final environmental impact statements if: (i) The agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns; or (ii) There are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.” 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(c)(1); see also 33 C.F.R. § 230.13(b). Tenth Circuit law is clear that “a party waives issues and arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.” M.D. Mark, Inc. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 565 F.3d 753, 768 n. 7 (10th Cir.2009). Plaintiffs fifty-five page opening brief is silent with respect to any argument about the need to prepare a supplemental EIS. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff waived this argument and the Court need not consider it. IV. CONCLUSION For the reasons set forth above, the Court AFFIRMS the October 18, 2008 Record of Decision. Judgment shall be entered forthwith in favor of Defendant. . The Court notes that the Record of Decision was published in the Federal Register on November 18, 2008. 73 Fed.Reg. 68,494 (Nov. 18, 2008). . During the screening process, alterations and/or variations to the twenty-three originally proposed alternatives were made. (AR 20526.) This resulted in an additional twenty-one alternatives having been screened or considered at some point during the process. (AR 20526.) . Even though the Vision Plan was not longer a viable option, the environmental impacts of the Vision Plan were retained in the FEIS for continuity purposes. (AR 8071.) . An environmental assessment is another method of fulfilling NEPA's procedural requirements. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). An environmental assessment contains considerably less detail than an environmental impact statement and is the preferred option where it is uncertain whether a proposed action will significantly affect the environment. Utah Envtl. Cong. v. Bosworth, 443 F.3d 732, 736 (10th Cir.2006) (citing 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9). . Plaintiff also argues that McAfee improperly influenced the public comment process after the DEIS was issued. (ECF No. 32 at 11-12.) On the last day of the public comment period, McAfee sent an e-mail to Ellen Ittelson, an employee of the City and County of Denver, asking Ittelson to solicit favorable comments. (AR 19326.) Presumably in response to Ittelson’s request, a number of last-minute comments favorable to the development were posted to the website. Plaintiff argues that its comments, as well as comments from its members, were ignored in favor of the positive comments solicited by McAfee. (ECF No. 32 at 13.) Defendant has acknowledged that Plaintiff’s comments were omitted from the FEIS and ROD. It claims that the omission was inadvertent rather than malicious. The Administrative Record supports Defendant’s contention. The Record reflects that the preparers were genuinely caught off guard when notified that not all comments were in the FEIS. The Record also shows that, once made aware of the additional comments, Defendant considered them and supplemented the FEIS with Plaintiff’s and its member's comments. (AR 19822.) Because Defendant has explained the inadvertent omission of Plaintiff’s comments, Plaintiff has failed to show any dispute as to whether its comments were fully considered during the decision-making process. The Court views the dispute over Plaintiff's comments and the comments solicited by McAfee as a red herring. To the extent that there was any wrongdoing, it certainly did not override the validity of the exhaustive seven-year development process described above. . Plaintiff argues that some courts have rejected the \"independent utility” test as inconsistent with CEQ regulations. (ECF No. 68 at 29 (citing Daniel R. Mandelker, NEPA Law and Litigation, §§ 3:4, 3:6 (2009)).) However, this Court is bound by Tenth Circuit law and, despite Plaintiff’s invitation, cannot ignore binding precedent on this issue. Tenth Circuit law is clear that actions with \"independent utility” are not \"connected” for purposes of 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25. Utahns for Better Transportation, 305 F.3d at 1183. .

Since receiving an unfavorable outcome on direct appeal and having his cert, petition denied by the Supreme Court, Reynolds has inundated the District Court with pro se motions. Several of these post-judgment motions concern what Reynolds believes to be “fraud upon the court,” and were filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60 or under Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 249-50, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944). The District Court recently disposed of these motions in a Memorandum Opinion and Order entered on March 8, 2011. In its Memorandum Opinion, the District Court made specific reference to the various miscellaneous motions — including one for “Summary Judgment Upon Respondent [sic] Failure to Rebut Under Rule 36 Admission of All Facts” — that Reynolds filed in conjunction with his Rule 60 and Hazel-Atlas motions, and denied those motions without further discussion. See Dist. Ct. Mem. Order at 4. The District Court likewise denied Reynolds’ latest bail motion. See id. at 5. Accordingly, his petition for writ of mandamus seeking to compel the District Court to dispose of these motions is moot. To the extent Reynolds may be seeking to challenge the District Court’s disposition of his various post-judgment motions, such review is available in the form of an appeal to this Court. A writ is not a substitute for an appeal; only if a direct appeal is unavailable will the court determine whether a writ of mandamus will issue. See In re Ford Motor Co., 110 F.3d 954, 957 (3d Cir.1997). We note that Reynolds has since perfected an appeal from the District Court’s decision at C.A. No. 11-1839. Any arguments he wishes to advance in support of that appeal should, of course, be included in his filings submitted under that docket number. Reynolds has also filed a motion in the instant proceeding seeking the recusal of District Court Judge Kosik on the basis of personal bias. While a mandamus petition is a proper means of challenging a district judge’s refusal to recuse himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455, see In re Sch. Asbestos Litig., 977 F.2d 764, 774-75 (3d Cir.1992), it does not appear that Judge Kosik has yet entertained Reynolds’ recusal motion. Given that a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is only available where a litigant has no other adequate means of obtaining the desired relief, we have recognized that it would not be appropriate to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the disqualification of a district judge if a motion for recusal is pending in the District Court. See In re Kensington Int’l Ltd., 353 F.3d 211, 223-24 (3d Cir.2003). As was noted, “[discretion is confided in the district judge in the first instance to determine whether to disqualify himself ... [because the] judge presiding over a case is in the best position to appreciate the implications of those matters alleged in a recusal motion.” Id. *118at 224 (quoting In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., 861 F.2d 1307, 1312 (2d Cir.1988)). Because Reynolds continues to file motions in the District Court, see Mot. pending at D. Ct. docket entry # 429, and Judge Kosik — who has presided over this case for the past six years — has not yet ruled on the motion for recusal that Reynolds filed on January 27, 2011, we conclude that he has not demonstrated that mandamus relief is warranted. We likewise conclude that mandamus relief is not warranted as a result of the amount of time Reynolds’ motion has been pending on the District Court docket. Although an appellate court may issue a writ of mandamus on the ground that undue delay is tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction, see Madden v. Myers, 102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996), the manner in which a court controls its docket is discretionary. In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., 685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir. 1982). Given the fact that the mandamus petition Reynolds submitted to the District Court is captioned in this Court, it is questionable whether the District Court even realized it was a filing that was in need of a disposition. Accordingly, we conclude that there has been no undue delay on the part of the District Court in disposing of Reynolds’ petition. Now that Reynolds has clarified his intent to have Judge Kosik rule on his mandamus petition despite it having been addressed to this Court, we are confident that a ruling will be forthcoming in the near future. Reynolds’ motions for the admission of facts and to compel the admission of facts under Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a)(3), for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, and for a bail release hearing based on the admission of facts will also be denied. Rules 36 and 56 are applicable to proceedings pending in the District Court, and Reynolds’ challenge to the District Court’s denial of his motion for bail and/or a bail hearing is within the purview of his appeal at C.A. No. 11-1839. Pursuant to Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 9.1, an appeal from such an order shall be by motion filed either concurrently with or promptly after filing a notice of appeal. Thus, Reynolds should file his bail motion in that appellate proceeding if he has not done so already. Reynolds’ recently filed “Omnibus Motion Under F.R.A.P. 31(a)(1) and F.R.Civ.P. 36(a)(3)” is likewise denied. Once again, Rule 36 is applicable to proceedings in the District Court. The filing of an answer or any briefing required by the Court in a mandamus proceeding is governed by Fed. RApp. P. 21(b)(1) and (5).","volume":"430","reporter":"F.

Six Unknown Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), claiming that Jamie Penaflor, a physician’s assistant at a federal prison in Wisconsin, violated the Eighth Amendment by refusing to treat a rash on his arms and legs. The district court concluded that Hudson failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, see 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), and granted summary judgment to Penaflor. We affirm. In January 2008 Hudson filed a “Request for an Administrative Remedy,” also called a “BP-9,” see 28 C.F.R. § 542.14(a), complaining to the warden that Penaflor had failed to treat swelling and pain in his left knee and leg, as well as a rash on his legs, left arm, and one finger. He attached a copy of an informal complaint, labeled a “BP-8,” in which he accused Penaflor of refusing to provide proper treatment for the swelling in his leg and the rash on his arm. In response, the warden wrote that a health-services administrator had visited Hudson to discuss his complaint and that Hudson had “indicated that each issue had been resolved.” The warden did not mention the swelling or the rash specifically. Hudson appealed the warden’s response to the regional director, using form BP-10. See 28 C.F.R. § 542.15(b)(1). He wrote that the “issues” had “not been addressed properly” because Penaflor “refused” to provide proper treatment. And the health-services administrator, he insisted, “did not take any steps to help with the problem.” He then complained specifically about the swelling without mentioning the rash. In the last line of his appeal, he referred to attached copies of his BP-8 and BP-9. The regional director affirmed the warden’s decision, noting that prison medical staff complied with prison regulations in treating Hudson’s condition. Within a month, Hudson appealed to the Bureau of Prison’s Central Office, using form BP-11. See 28 C.F.R. § 542.15(b)(1). He said that he “could not walk or stand without pain or sleep because of the swelling,” and he again referred to and attached his BP-8 and BP-9. He again did not mention the rash. An administrator at the Central Office denied the appeal, concluding that Hudson was “receiving medical care and treatment in accordance with Bureau policy.” Hudson then filed this Bivens action, alleging only that Penaflor acted with deliberate indifference in refusing to treat the rash. Penaflor countered by producing Hudson’s grievance record and moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Penaflor *625pointed out that BOP regulations require prisoners appealing a grievance to “state specifically the reason for the appeal,” 28 C.F.R. § 542.15(b)(1), and argued that, by not mentioning the rash in either of his administrative appeals, Hudson failed to meet that requirement. The district court dismissed Hudson’s complaint, determining that he failed to state specifically that the rash was the reason for his BP-11 appeal. The court accepted Hudson’s remark in his BP-10 that “issues” had “not been addressed properly” — along with his attachment of the BP-8 and BP-9 — as sufficient to raise his concern about the rash, but concluded that the BP-11 was insufficient because it “focuses solely on the swelling.” Since the parties had submitted documents outside the public record and did not dispute the facts about exhaustion, the court converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and granted it. Hudson now argues that the district court attached “insupportable significance” to his failure to mention the rash in his BP-11. In response, the government contends that Hudson insufficiently raised his. concern about the rash in either his BP-10 or BP-11 and therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to either form. The government’s argument is persuasive. Because federal prisoners must comply with BOP regulations to properly exhaust administrative remedies, see Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007); Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646, 650 (7th Cir.2002), they are prohibited from raising issues in federal court that they did not “state specifically” as a reason for their administrative appeals, see 28 C.F.R. § 542.15(b)(1). This rule furthers the policies underlying § 1997e(a) by enabling prison officials to fairly adjudicate prisoners’ claims and discouraging prisoners from skirting the administrative process. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 203-04, 127 S.Ct. 910; Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90, 95, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). Even if we construed Hudson’s BP-10 in his favor, the closest that form came to addressing the rash was to assert vaguely that “issues” had “not been addressed properly” and to incorporate by reference other documents that described the rash, among other concerns. These actions were insufficient to “state specifically” that the rash was a reason for his appeal, so he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. AFFIRMED.","volume":"448","reporter":"F.

On April 26, 2011, Alejandro Francisco Sánchez-Mujica, as the Foreign Representative of the above-captioned Debtor,1 Vi-tro, S.A.B. de C.V. (‘Vitro SAB”) in: (a) the Voluntary Mexican Proceeding commenced on December 13, 2010 under the Mexican Business Reorganization Act and currently pending before the District Court of Nuevo León; and (b) this Chapter 15 Case, filed his motion (the “Motion”), pursuant to sections 105(a), 1507(b), 1519(a) and 1521(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, made applicable to this proceeding through Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7065, for a temporary restraining *574order and preliminary injunction, based on his complaint for injunctive relief in this adversary proceeding. This memorandum opinion constitutes the Court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052. The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334 and 151, and the standing order of reference in this district. This proceeding is core, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(P). I. Background Facts Vitro SAB is a corporation with variable capital (sociedad anónima bursátil de capital variable) organized under the laws of Mexico and originally incorporated in 1909. Vitro SAB is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its multinational operations through subsidiaries (collectively, ‘Vitro”). Vitro is the largest manufacturer of glass containers and flat glass in Mexico, with consolidated net sales in 2010 of Ps. 23,360 million ($1,849 million). Vitro has manufacturing facilities in 11 countries and distribution centers throughout the Americas and Europe, maintains a workforce of approximately 17,000 worldwide, about 85% of whom are located in Mexico, and exports its products to more than 50 countries. The Senior Notes On October 22, 2003 and on February 1, 2007, respectively, Vitro SAB issued the following notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes” or “Old Notes”) (i) $225 million aggregate principal amount of 11.75% Senior Notes due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”), and (ii) $1.0 billion of Senior Notes, comprised of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625% Senior Notes due 2012 (the “2012 Notes”), and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 9.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”), under separate indentures (as each has been supplemented from time to time, (collectively, the “Indentures,”)). The Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of Vitro SAB, guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by substantially all of Vitro SAB’s wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. Due to the global financial crisis in 2008 and the corresponding downturn in business worldwide, as well as volatility in the financial and commodity markets that adversely impacted Vitro’s hedged interest, currency and commodity positions, Vitro SAB did not have enough cash to meet all of its obligations and stopped making scheduled interest payments on the Senior Notes, and other indebtedness to sustain current operations. This also resulted in derivatives-related litigation (the “DFI Litigation”) filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York demanding payment of approximately $240.3 million plus interest for Vitro’s failure to meet its margin call obligations. As of December 31, 2010, Vitro’s aggregate outstanding third-party consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.710 billion, $1.216 billion of which represents the outstanding principal amount owed on these Senior Notes. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, Vitro SAB’s aggregate outstanding indebtedness to its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Intercompany Claims”) was approximately $2.022 billion. The nature of, and motivation behind, these Intercompany Claims is of great dispute between the parties. In December 2009 Vitro SAB and Fintech Investments, Ltd. (together, with its subsidiaries, “Fin-tech”) entered into several simultaneous transactions which caused Fintech to invest $75 million, and generated $1.5 billion in intercompany debt, payable to Vitro SAB’s subsidiaries by Vitro SAB. It is alleged that these transactions amount to fraudulent transfers on the part of Vitro SAB, and are an attempt by Vitro SAB’s *575equity holders to control any attempts at reorganization. Restructuring Efforts In February 2009, Vitro SAB announced its intention to globally restructure all of its outstanding debt, and began negotiations with its creditors. Following this announcement, several noteholders formed an ad hoc group of Vitro noteholders (the “Ad Hoc Noteholder Group”) and began negotiations, but they were not able to work out an agreement with Vitro. In January 2010, members of this Ad Hoc Noteholder Group claiming to hold at least 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes accelerated the 2012 Notes and the 2017 Notes, and the indenture trustee for the 2013 Notes sent an acceleration notice with respect to the 2013 Notes. In addition, in April 2010, Vitro SAB and certain of its Mexican subsidiaries were found hable by the Supreme Court of New York in the DFI Litigation. Fintech acquired the claims of the counter-parties to the derivative transactions with Vitro, and settled these claims in exchange for promissory notes. These developments, among other things, led Vitro SAB to explore alternative means to implement a restructuring, such as an in-court restructuring in Mexico. On November 1, 2010, Vitro SAB began soliciting a pre-packaged plan of reorganization in Mexico, effectuated through a tender offer and an exchange offer, and on December 13, 2010, filed a voluntary judicial reorganization proceeding (the “Voluntary Mexican Proceeding”) under the Ley de Concursos Mercantiles (the “Mexican Business Reorganization Act”) in the Federal District Court for Civil and Labor Matters for the State of Nuevo León, the United States of Mexico (the “District Court of Nuevo León”), seeking approval of a pre-packaged, “concurso ” restructuring plan. Prior to the concurso filing in Mexico, on November 17, 2010 (the “Petition Date”), Knighthead Master Fund, L.P., Brookville Horizons Fund, L.P., Davidson Kempner Distressed Opportunities Fund, LP, and Lord Abbett Bond-Debenture Fund, Inc. (collectively, the “Petitioning Creditors”), filed an involuntary petition against fifteen of the U.S. subsidiaries of Vitro SAB under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (collectively, the “Involuntary Petitions”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. These involuntary petitions were originally contested by the alleged debtors in each case; however, on April 6, 2011, Vitro America, Super Sky International, Super Sky Products, and WP Finance moved for entry of orders for relief, and the Court entered such orders on that same date. The remaining involuntary petitions were dismissed, but those dismissal orders are currently the subject of motions for new trial that have not yet been heard by the Court. Subsequently, WP Holdings and WP Funding filed voluntary petitions, that have been jointly administered with Vitro America, Super Sky International, Super Sky Products, and WP Finance under case number 11-32600, (collectively, the “U.S. Debtors”). On December 2 and 9, 2010, respectively, Aurelius Capital Management, LP. (“Aurelius”) and Elliott Management Corp. (“Elliott”), two entities that manage or control funds that hold Vitro SAB’s Senior Notes, commenced substantially identical law suits in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Vitro SAB and 49 of its subsidiaries in their capacities as guarantors of Vitro SAB’s bond note debt for breach of contract and payment of accelerated principal and accrued interest (the “NYS Actions”). In each case, the *576respective plaintiff obtained an ex parte order of attachment with respect to all property of any Defendant located in the State of New York. These attachments continue to be the subject of litigation before the courts in New York. On January 7, 2011, the request for a concurso mercantil, which is a bankruptcy in Mexico filed for a business debtor, was denied in the Voluntary Mexican Proceeding, because the Mexican court found that intercompany claims should not be considered and, therefore, the voluntary concur-so petition and concurso plan did not meet the requirements for a prepackaged proceeding under the Mexican Business Reorganization Act. This decision was appealed, and on April 8, 2011, a Mexican appellate court reversed this decision and issued a declaration of concurso mercantil. The Chapter 15 Petition Vitro originally filed a Chapter 15 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on December 14, 2010, for recognition of its Voluntary Mexican Proceeding, which was withdrawn prior to any decision being made by agreement of the parties after the denial of the concurso by the Mexican bankruptcy court. The Chapter 15 case was re-filed by Vitro SAB, after the decision of the Mexican appellate court. By filing its Chapter 15 Case, Vitro SAB has applied for recognition of the Voluntary Mexican Proceeding as a “foreign main proceeding” under sections 1515 and 1517 of the Bankruptcy Code. The recognition hearing is currently set for June 28, 2011, before this Court. Vitro SAB filed both of its Chapter 15 petitions in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and each time the Petitioning Creditors filed motions in the jointly administered cased before this Court, jointly administered under case number 11-36200, to transfer venue to this Court, based on the prior filed related cased, pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 1014(b). After hearing the motion to transfer venue, on May 16, 2011, this Court entered an order granting the motion to transfer, which resulted in both the main case and associated adversary proceeding being transferred to this Court. Pi'ior to the Court’s determination of the Petitioning Creditors’ motion to transfer, while the Chapter 15 case was still pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, on April 26, 2011, Judge Houser, at the direction of this Court, signed an order modifying the stay to permit Vitro SAB to seek from the New York Bankruptcy Court: relief under sections 105(a) and 1519 of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rule 7065 restraining, enjoining or staying the commencement or continuation of any and all litigation or actions to collect (including, without limitation, pursuant to the Attachment Orders) with respect to the Restructured Debt (including the Old Notes) against itself or any of its subsidiaries to the extent such subsidiary is not otherwise entitled to protection pursuant to section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. For the avoidance of doubt, the relief Vitro SAB is permitted hereunder to seek from the [New York Bankruptcy] Court includes, without limitation, a stay of the proceedings currently pending before the New York State Court in the NYS Actions, but shall not include removal of the NYS Actions to the [New York Bankruptcy] Court. See Lift Stay Order, Dkt. No. 410, 11-32600. Alejandro Francisco Sánchez-Mujica then filed his Verified Complaint for Temporary Restraining Order and Injunctive Relief requesting a temporary restraining *577order pursuant to sections 105(a) and 1519 of the Bankruptcy Code restraining and enjoining all the holders of the debt that it intends to restructure or discharge in the Voluntary Mexican Proceeding from commencing or continuing any and all litigation or actions to collect against Vitro SAB and its subsidiaries (the “Protected Parties”), other than the subsidiaries currently protected by the stay imposed under 11 U.S.C. § 362 by virtue of their pending bankruptcies filed in the United States. In the complaint, Vitro SAB additionally requests that, notwithstanding the Attachment Orders, all garnishees be ordered to remit all payments to the applicable Protected Parties in accordance with the ordinary practices that existed between each such garnishee and the applicable Protected Party prior to their being served with the an attachment order. Vitro SAB further requests in its complaint that Preliminary Injunction pursuant to sections 105(a) and 1519 of the Bankruptcy Code, substantially on the same terms as the temporary restraining order, to remain in effect until a decision is rendered with respect to recognition of the Voluntary Mexican Proceeding as the “foreign main proceeding” pursuant to section 1517 of the Bankruptcy Code. Finally, Vitro SAB requests that, if and when the Court recognizes the Voluntary Mexican Proceeding as the “foreign main proceeding,” the Court enter an order pursuant to sections 105(a), 1507(b) and 1521(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code extending the Preliminary Injunction as it relates to the Protected Parties through the conclusion of the Voluntary Mexican Proceeding. Alternatively, Vitro SAB requests that the Court extend the automatic stay to any Actions by the Creditors against the Protected Parties that are not then otherwise so protected for the duration of its Chapter 15 Case. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York issued a temporary restraining order that was extended by the agreement of the parties until after this Court’s determination of the Petitioning Creditors’ motion to transfer venue and then for discovery, briefing and hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction, which was heard on June 13-15, 2011. II. Issues There are two main issues presented by Vitro SAB’s motion for injunctive relief: (1)does the Court have the authority under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code to issue a preliminary injunction to protect Vitro SAB and its non-debtor guarantor subsidiaries; and (2) has Vitro SAB and its non-debtor subsidiaries met the requirements for a preliminary injunction to issue. II. Analysis Protections Available Under Chapter 15 Pre-recognition Injunctions In the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (“BAPCPA”) Congress enacted Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code, “so as to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of cross-border insolvency.” 11 U.S.C. § 1501(a). “In order for a foreign proceeding to gain recognition within the framework of Chapter 15, the following prerequisites must be met: (1) such foreign proceeding for which recognition is sought is a foreign main proceeding or foreign nonmain proceeding within the meaning of section 1502; (2) the foreign representative applying for recognition is a person or body; and (3) the petition meets the requirements of section 1515. *57811 U.S.C. § 1517(a).” In re Ran, 607 F.3d 1017, 1021 (5th Cir.2010) (citing In re Bet-corp Ltd., 400 B.R. 266, 285 (Bankr.D.Nev. 2009)). Section 1515 imposes several pleading requirements on a Chapter 15 petition for recognition: (a) A foreign representative applies to the court for recognition of a foreign proceeding in which the foreign representative has been appointed by filing a petition for recognition. (b) A petition for recognition shall be accompanied by— (1) a certified copy of the decision commencing such foreign proceeding and appointing the foreign representative; (2) a certifícate from the foreign court affirming the existence of such foreign proceeding and of the appointment of the foreign representative; or (3) in the absence of evidence referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2), any other evidence acceptable to the court of the existence of such foreign proceeding and of the appointment of the foreign representative. (c) A petition for recognition shall also be accompanied by a statement identifying all foreign proceedings with respect to the debtor that are known to the foreign representative. (d) The documents referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) shall be translated into English. The court may require a translation into English of additional documents. 11 U.S.C. § 1515. The requirements are in place because “[t]he consequences of an order recognizing a foreign main proceeding are substantial. Most dramatically, the U.S. automatic stay, in all its details, applies immediately with respect to the debtor and property of the debtor that is located within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.” In re Artimm, S.r.L., 335 B.R. 149, 159 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.2005), see also 11 U.S.C. § 1520. Section 1520 provides a non-exhaustive list of the effect of recognition of a foreign main proceeding, including: “(1) an automatic stay of actions against the debtor under Bankruptcy Code Section 362; (2) the ability to operate the debtor’s business; (3) examination of witnesses; and (4) the entrusting of the administration of the debtor’s United States assets to the foreign representative.” In re Ran, 607 F.3d at 1021; 11 U.S.C. § 1520(a)(l)-(3). Relief Available During the Gap Period Section 1519 of the Bankruptcy Code sets forth the provisional relief that a court may grant during the “gap period,” which is the period between the filing of a chapter 15 petition and a court’s determination of whether to grant recognition to the relevant foreign proceeding. See In re Pro-Fit Holdings Ltd., 391 B.R. 850, 858 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.2008). Section 1519 provides, in pertinent part: (a) From the time of filing a petition for recognition until the court rules on the petition, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, where relief is urgently needed to protect the assets of the debtor or interests of the creditors, grant relief of a provisional nature, including (1) staying execution against the debt- or’s assets; (2) entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the debtor’s assets located in the United States to the foreign representative or another person authorized by the court, including an examiner, in order to protect and preserve the value of assets that, by their nature or because of other circumstances, are perishable, susceptible to devaluation or otherwise in jeopardy; and *579(3) any relief referred to in paragraph (3), (4), or (7) of section 1521(a). 11 U.S.C. § 1519(a)(l)-(3). Looking to section 1521(a)(7), it provides that: (a) Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether main or nonmain, where necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and to protect the assets of the debtor or interests of the creditors, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any appropriate relief, including (7) granting any additional relief that may be available to a trustee, except for relief available under sections 522, 544, 545, 547, 548, 550, and 724(a). 11 U.S.C. § 1521(a)(7). If recognition is granted under Chapter 15, courts also have the ability to “provide additional assistance to a foreign representative under [Title 11] or under other laws of the United States.” 11 U.S.C. § 1507(a). Relief granted under section 1520 is automatic, where relief under section 1521 will only be granted if “the interests of the creditors and other interested entities, including the debtor, are sufficiently protected.” 11 U.S.C. § 1522(a). Additionally, any provisional relief granted under section 1519 prior to recognition is automatically extended upon entry of the order of recognition of the foreign proceeding. One of the objections to the Motion before the Court asserts that the Court lacks the statutory authority to stay, prior to recognition of the Voluntary Mexican Proceeding, the continuation of the NYS Actions against Vitro SAB and its non-debtor subsidiary guarantors, who are also defendants in those actions, because section 1521(a)(1) is not among those sections explicitly incorporated into section 1519(a)(3), and this power is not otherwise specifically enumerated in section 1519. However, as stated previously, the relief enumerated in section 1519 is not all-inclusive. See 11 U.S.C. § 1519(a) (“including”); see also In re Ran, 607 F.3d at 1021 (1519(a)(l)-(3) represents a “non-exhaustive list of relief available to a foreign proceeding’s representative in a Chapter 15”); In re Pro-Fit Int’l Ltd., 391 B.R. 850, 866 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.2008). Further, section 1521(a)(7) states that the relief that may be granted includes “granting any additional relief that may be available to a trustee, except for relief available under sections 522,554, 545, 547, 548, 550, and 724(a).” 11 U.S.C. § 1521(a)(7); see also In re Condor Ins. Ltd., 601 F.3d 319, 324-25 (5th Cir.2010) (section 1521(a)(7) provides for “any relief’ and “includes no other language suggesting that other relief might be excepted”). The plain language of section 1519 of the Bankruptcy Code does not contain a limitation on the Court’s authority to issue a stay or injunction, and that is where the Court’s analysis must end. See United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989). Thus, protections afforded under §§ 362 and 105 are available to Vitro SAB prior to recognition of the foreign main proceeding. The Court finds that it is empowered under sections 1519(a), 362 and 105 of the Bankruptcy Code to issue the Preliminary Injunction in favor of Vitro SAB to protect its assets, until such time as a determination on recognition is made. Vitro SAB has brought forth evidence illustrating that, upon approval of this injunction, a successful reorganization would be probable. The Mexican Appellate court found that the voluntary concurso petition and plan satisfied the requirements under the Mexican Reorganization Act, and the Court has a recognition hearing that is scheduled to occur within the next week, *580limiting the duration of the stay under 1519(a) should the recognition proceeding fail. Protection available to the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries Having concluded that the Court has the power to enjoin actions against Vitro SAB and its assets, the Court must determine if these protections can be extended to Vitro SAB’s non-debtor subsidiaries. Vitro SAB argues that this injunction may be extended to its non-debtor subsidiaries by virtue of Section 1519, and that such a third-party injunction is both within the power of the Court and necessary to protect the interests of creditors. Vitro SAB relies on the language in section 1519 which provides that the Court may grant relief where it is “urgently needed to protect the assets of the debtor or the interests of creditors.” 11 U.S.C. § 1519(a) (emphasis added). Further, the Court would have “related to” jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Code to protect the subsidiary non-debtor guarantors on the basis of their upstream payments to Vitro SAB that it must rely on to complete its reorganization in Mexico. See In re Seat-co, Inc., 257 B.R. 469, 476 (Bankr.N.D.Tex. 2001). The Preliminary Injunction Having determined that the Court has the authority to enjoin the NYS Actions and other collection efforts against Vitro SAB’s non-debtor guarantors, the Court must now determine if they meet the requirements for a preliminary injunction under these facts. Courts in this district have enjoined litigation against non-debtors in limited circumstances, including (1) when the non-debtor and debtor enjoy such an identity of interest that the suit against the non-debtor is essentially a suit against the debtor, and (2) when the third party action will have an adverse impact on the debt- or’s ability to accomplish reorganization. In re Bernhard Steiner Pianos USA, Inc., 292 B.R. 109, 116 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.2002) (citing In re Zale Corp., 62 F.3d 746, 761 (5th Cir.1995)). The circumstances in both instances involved creditors receiving one hundred cents on the dollar through a plan, and if the debtor failed to provide payments, then the injunction would dissolve. Injunctions issued under § 105 outside of a plan of reorganization may be granted only “under the usual rules for the issuance of an injunction.” In re Commonwealth Oil Refining Co., 805 F.2d 1175, 1188 (5th Cir.1986). For the Court to grant a preliminary injunction, the mov-ant must show: (1) that he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest. Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 129 S.Ct. 365, 374, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (U.S.2008); see also In re Commonwealth Oil Refining Co., 805 F.2d at 1189 (requiring the movant to show a “substantial likelihood” of success on the merits and a “substantial threat” of irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, as to the first and second factors, respectively). Vitro contends that the likelihood of success on the merits should be defined as the likelihood of completing a successful reorganization in Mexico. The Ad Hoc Note-holder Group, however, argues that this definition of “merits” is erroneous and ill-founded. According to Commonwealth Oil Refining Co., the “merits,” with regard to the four-pronged preliminary injunction test, refer not to the successful completion of reorganization, but to the non-bankruptcy action itself. Commonwealth Oil Refin*581ing Co. specifically states that, “the inquiry for a preliminary injunction necessarily focuses on the outcome ... of the questions giving rise to the litigation.” Id., 805 F.2d 1175, 1189 (5th Cir.1986). In this instance, the questions giving rise to the litigation are the desired collection efforts the Ad Hoc Noteholder Group seeks to implement against the guarantors of the notes, i.e. actions at law by the noteholders against the guarantors. The evidence is divided on this issue. The second factor to consider is irreparable injury. Vitro contends that irreparable injury will result if the injunction is not granted. It argues that Vitro S.A.B. is merely a holding company, and that the company’s cash flow is derived solely from its subsidiaries. If the creditors are not prevented from collection efforts against the subsidiaries, then the direct result will be harm to Vitro S.A.B. and the reorganization process will be thwarted. A key aspect in illustrating irreparable harm is demonstrating that the mov-ant has no other adequate remedy at law. Janvey v. Alguire, 628 F.3d 164, 179 (5th Cir.2010) (“a harm is irreparable where there is no adequate remedy at law, such as monetary damages”). Here, the non-debtor subsidiaries do indeed have an adequate remedy at law. If so desired, the non-debtor subsidiary guarantors could file insolvency proceedings in either Mexico or the United States. Vitro has provided no explanation, other than the reluctance of creditors to deal with an entity in bankruptcy, as to why the non-debtor subsidiary guarantors cannot or should not initiate their own insolvency proceedings. For this reason, the second factor favors the Ad Hoc Noteholder Group. Also, Vitro SAB will not suffer irreparable injury, i.e., it will still have an opportunity at a successful reorganization, if the noteholders are permitted to pursue their respective guaranty claims against the non-debtor subsidiary guarantors. Without a showing of irreparable injury to Vitro SAB and its non-debtor subsidiaries it is hard to find that the harm placed on Vitro outweighs the harm placed on the noteholders, the third factor to be considered. Currently, the holders of the Senior Notes are owed approximately $1.2 billion in accelerated principal combined with approximately $300 million of past due interest. Vitro S.A.B. argues that the only potential harm to the noteholders is that they will not be paid as quickly as they wish. However, if this injunction is granted, the noteholders will be required to delay collection efforts while reorganization proceedings are pending in Mexico. This will result in the noteholders being substantially harmed by the lost interest and the possible cram down of their notes as a result of Vitro SAB’s reorganization proceedings. Furthermore, the noteholders will have to adjudicate their claims and appeals in the Mexican legal system even though the notes were issued under indentures governed by New York law, underwritten by U.S. banks, and registered with the SEC. This illustrates the intent to have access to the U.S. courts. The harm to the note-holders far outweighs the harm to the Debtor; this factor favors the Ad Hoc Noteholder Group. Finally, the granting of an injunction will disserve the public interest. Extending the automatic stay or issuing an injunction for non-debtors contravenes a basic and compelling principle of federal bankruptcy law. Like the rest of the Code, Chapter 15 focuses on protecting the debtors, not the non-debtor subsidiaries. If granted, precedent will be set that any foreign debtor can initiate insolvency proceedings solely for a parent holding com*582pany in a foreign jurisdiction, get an injunction protecting non-debtor subsidiaries in the United States, and confirm a plan through insider votes leaving creditors in the United States with little recourse. Additionally, in chapter 15 cases courts strive to uphold comity. Comity is not furthered by granting an injunction when such an injunction may not, according to expert testimony at the hearing, be recognized under Mexican law. The public interest will be disserved by granting this injunction; this factor favors the Ad Hoc Note-holder Group. Limited Injunctions for third parties have been granted in the past in order to effectuate the debtor’s ability to reorganize. This Court has granted an injunction in order to allow a successful reorganization process after the movant met all four factors at a confirmation hearing. In re Bernhard Steiner Pianos USA, Inc., 292 B.R. 109, 118 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.2002). In Bernhard Steiner, the creditors entered into loan agreements with the debtor company, secured by personal guarantees of the business owner. Id. at 112. In regards to the circumstances of granting the temporary injunction, first, the debtor’s representative in Bernhard Steiner testified that being forced to defend against lawsuits on behalf of his company would drain his personal time and resources, which would be better used to conduct day-to-day operations of the business. Id. at 117. Second, the Court found that subjecting the principal’s interest in the company to thirsty creditors while the debtor was attempting to run the reorganized business and pay off creditors would adversely impact other necessary parties to the proceeding and thwart attempts to successfully reorganize. Id. Proceeding to the injunction factors, the Court found all factors were sufficiently met to grant the injunction. Id. at 118. The Court found: (1) The creditors would be paid in full, should the injunction be granted and reorganization efforts protected; (2) the debtor faced a substantial threat of irreparable injury and would be prevented from successfully reorganizing if the creditors had been permitted to pursue claims; (3) the creditors would not suffer irreparable harm because they had an adequate remedy and would have been affected, if at all, in only a minimal fashion; (4) finally, the reorganization process was in the public interest and granting the injunction would not disserve that interest. Id. Due to the sufficiency of the factors, the Court granted the debtor the temporary injunction. Id. Another bankruptcy judge in this district previously overruled an objection to a permanent injunction that had no effect on the creditor whatsoever. In re Seatco, 259 B.R. 279, 283 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.2001) (Houser, C.J.). The debtor’s modified plan provided, inter alia, that the plan would not prohibit the creditor from perfecting or enforcing its claims or interests. See id. Further, the debtor sought a temporary injunction under its modified plan. Id. This provision merely restrained the creditor from collecting from the debtor and provided that, should the plan be confirmed, the creditor would then be free to pursue its claims for any amounts not being paid under the plan. Id. Similar to Bernhard Steiner, the Court stated that, if the debtor defaulted on payments to the creditor, after notice and an opportunity to cure, the creditor was free to pursue the debtor for all amounts owed to it without further court order. Id. The Court found that the only harm to the creditor from plan confirmation would be forcing the creditor to accept less than favorable payments. Id. at 284. Thus, the Court held that the temporary injunction was necessary and appropriate. Id. This ruling was *583also made at the time of confirmation of the plan. The facts before the Court today fit neither one of these models. The proceedings in Mexico are in an early stage. It is unclear that they will be successful, or that creditors, such as the noteholders will be paid in full. In contrast to the third party injunction cases mentioned above, Vitro SAB has asked for an injunction to protect third parties and offers no protections or assurances of payment to creditors. For example, the proposed injunction would not restrict the subsidiaries in their ordinary operations, allow for transparency and reporting to creditors, or provide for restrictions on the transfer of property. The Court would have little control over the actual reorganization proceedings and once the attachment orders in the NYS Actions were lifted, the assets of the subsidiaries could be quickly funneled to Mexico. Finally, Vitro relies heavily on In re Schimmelpenninck, 183 F.3d 347 (5th Cir. 1999). However, this case is not applicable in the eyes of this Court. Both the present case before the Court and Schimmel-penninck involve a foreign bankruptcy proceeding, but in Schimmelpenninck, the claim against the subsidiary was considered an asset of the parent company, which was sought by the creditor. The parent company in Schimmelpenninck was the sole obligor of the notes. Id. at 358. Under these facts, the Court found it necessary to grant the injunctive relief, because denial of such remedy would disadvantage other creditors by allowing the claimant creditor to circumvent other creditors and gain preferential status against an asset found to be an asset of the debtor parent. Id. at 358, 360. Under the present facts, however, Vitro SAB’s subsidiaries are independently liable as guarantors of the notes and their assets are liable for repayment. Unlike Schimmelpenninck, granting the injunction here would adversely and unnecessarily prevent the noteholders from pursuing the entities that are liable and would prejudice the creditors from their remedy at law. Vitro SAB seeks to enjoin the notehold-ers from pursuing claims against the guarantor subsidiaries, and it asks the Court to allow the Mexican reorganization to run its course. Vitro SAB is a separate holding company. It is this holding company that has filed for bankruptcy relief in Mexico, not the subsidiaries. The subsidiaries, which retain the company’s assets, independently contracted with the creditors for the guarantees. Essentially, Vitro SAB is seeking a short-cut to the system; rather than the subsidiaries filing for bankruptcy and independently receiving protection through an automatic stay, the parent company is asking the Court to grant blanket protection for it and its subsidiaries. Granting this, however, would be contrary to the creditors’ proper remedy at law — to file a claim against the subsidiary that is the guarantor of the note. Therefore, the non-debtor and debtor do not share an identity of interest to the extent that the suit against one is essentially a suit against the other. Further, the third party action is unlikely to have an adverse impact on the debtor’s ability to reorganize. Thus, enjoining creditors from pursuing claims against non-debtor parties in this scenario is improper. IV. Conclusion In conclusion, the Court finds that it has the authority under 105(a) and 1519(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 to issue the requested pre-recognition injunction, and such relief is granted for Vitro SAB. However, Vitro has not met its burden to show that this injunction should be extended to protect *584entities other than Vitro SAB and its assets, which do not include the non-debtor subsidiary guarantors. Limited Stay of This Ruling Because of the importance of this matter to the parties, this Court anticipates that this ruling may be appealed. The issue presented appears to be one of first impression since the enactment of Chapter 15. The case has national importance because of the issue, the amounts involved, and the number of parties affected. In order to maintain the status quo created by the temporary restraining order issued by the New York bankruptcy court and extended by agreement in this court after the change of venue, this Court will stay temporarily its ruling by extending the agreed injunction until Friday, July 1, 2011 at 5 p.m. Central Daylight Time. Any further stay or injunction will need to be sought and obtained in any appeal which may be filed. . An ad hoc group of Vitro noteholders (the \"Ad Hoc Noteholder Group”) has challenged the authority of Alejandro Francisco Sán-chez-Mujica to file the Chapter 15 proceeding. That issue will be decided at the recognition hearing, currently set for June 28, 2011. For purposes of this ruling, this court assumes that the Chapter 15 filing was proper.","volume":"455","reporter":"B.R.","page":"571","cite_type":"4","ltree":"federal_supreme.federal_appeal_5.federal_district_tx.federal_bankruptcy_tx_nd","generated_summary":"Vitro SAB is a corporation with variable capital organized under the laws of Mexico and originally incorporated in 1909.

A jury found him guilty on all counts, and he was sentenced to 240 months’ imprisonment. Keith filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed lawyer seeks to withdraw on the ground that the appeal is frivolous. See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Keith opposes counsel’s motion, see Cir. R. 51(b). We review only the potential issues identified in counsel’s facially adequate brief and in Keith’s response. See United States v. Schuh, 289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002). We grant counsel’s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. Before trial Keith moved to suppress statements that he made to law-enforcement officials during the investigation and arrest, when he admitted to downloading and sharing illegal child-pornography images through peer-to-peer filesharing software called Limewire. He argued that these admissions should be suppressed because he made them under coercive circumstances or without being advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). He also sought to suppress all evidence seized by law-enforcement officials. With both parties’ agreement, the district court delayed ruling on the motion until the trial’s conclusion, a practice we find odd and do not encourage. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(d) (“The court must decide every pretrial motion before trial unless it finds good cause to defer a ruling.”). At trial FBI agents testified to using Limewire to search for internet protocol (IP) addresses offering child pornography. Their searches uncovered an IP address belonging to Keith’s father in Kankakee, Illinois. Kankakee police told agent Jeffrey Heinze that Keith’s father had been seen observing children near a school bus stop. Believing that Keith’s father might be molesting children and sharing child pornography, Heinze obtained a warrant to search the Keith residence and seize digital media. Agents entered the residence a few days later at 5:50 p.m. and had their attention piqued after noticing Keith in a bedroom using a laptop. Agent Steven Evans recalled that Keith appeared nervous and responded to questions with “suspicious” answers. Keith told Heinze that he knew the agents were there because of “something that I was doing peer-to-peer” and acknowledged being the only resident who used Limewire. Meanwhile, a detective who examined Keith’s laptop with forensic software noticed that a file labeled “Limewire” and videos had been deleted at 5:56 p.m. Some deleted files had been placed on a USB adapter containing a memory card. When agents confronted Keith about these files, he responded that he had deleted them after seeing agents approaching the house. He admitted to using Limewire to search for, download, and share child-pornography images and to moving files onto a memory card, and he acknowledged downloading 60 child-pornography images that agents found on the laptop. Agent Greg Catey arrested Keith a year later. After receiving Miranda warnings, Keith told Catey about using Limewire to download child pornography. Keith allowed Catey to search his new laptop and *506other digital media; two months later Ca-tey obtained a warrant and searched and seized those materials. At trial the government introduced 32 still images or video clips of child pornography found on Keith’s computer equipment. Keith, who stipulated that the images depicted child pornography, moved under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 to bar the government from showing any more images, which he said were overly prejudicial. The court denied the motion, explaining that the government’s presentation of the images to the jury was appropriately limited; ten of the images were subsequently re-shown to the jury during the testimony of a pediatrician, who identified the children as being minors. After the government presented its case, the district court denied Keith’s motion to suppress. The court ruled that his statements to law-enforcement officials were admissible because he was not in custody during the investigation and he had voluntarily waived his Miranda rights during the arrest; the court also found admissible the evidence seized during the investigation and arrest because it was based on warrants that were properly issued. Keith subsequently moved for a judgment of acquittal, see Fed.R.CRIm.P. 29(c), which the court denied. The jury ultimately convicted Keith on all counts. He moved for a new trial based on insufficient evidence, see Fed. R.Crim.P. 33(a), but the court denied the motion. The court sentenced Keith to the statutory maximum of 240 months’ imprisonment on each count of distributing and receiving child pornography and destroying evidence, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1519, 2252A(b)(l), and to the statutory maximum of 120 months’ on each possession count, id. § 2252A(b)(2), to run concurrently. In her Anders submission, counsel first considers but correctly rejects arguing that the district court erred in denying Keith’s motion to suppress the materials seized during the investigation. Probable cause to support a search warrant exists when the totality of the circumstances known at the time would persuade a reasonably prudent person that a search will uncover evidence of a crime. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); United States v. Carson, 582 F.3d 827, 831 (7th Cir.2009). Such circumstances existed here: agents informed the magistrate judge that the Keiths’ IP address was offering child pornography through filesharing software and that local police had seen Keith’s father near a school bus stop. Counsel next considers whether Keith could argue that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements made to agents Evans and Heinze during the investigation because they did not read him his Miranda rights. We agree with counsel that this challenge would be frivolous because Keith was not in custody when questioned by both agents. A person is “in custody” for Miranda purposes when, given the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would not have felt free to end the interrogation and leave. Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 662, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004). Factors relevant to this inquiry include whether the suspect consented to speak with the officers; whether the officers informed the suspect that he was not under arrest and was free to leave; whether there was a threatening presence of several officers and a display of weapons or physical force; and whether the officers’ tone of voice was such that their requests were likely to be obeyed. United States v. Littledale, 652 F.3d 698, 700-702 (7th Cir.2011); United States v. Snodgrass, 635 F.3d 324, 327-28 (7th Cir.2011). Here, Keith was not restrained *507during his conversations with Evans and Heinze; the agents’ weapons were not drawn nor their voices raised; and Heinze told Keith that he was not under arrest, was free to leave, and did not have to speak if he did not want to. Counsel also considers but correctly rejects arguing that the district court erred in denying Keith’s motion to suppress statements made to Catey without a voluntary and knowing waiver of his Miranda rights. A suspect’s valid waiver of his Miranda rights requires that the “ ‘totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation’ reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension.” Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986) (internal citation omitted); see United States v. Vallar, 635 F.3d 271, 284 (7th Cir.2011). Here Catey testified that he spoke to Keith in a normal tone without drawing any weapons, and that Keith appeared to understand his Miranda rights, did not display any cognitive difficulties, spoke in a “very conversational” manner, and never asked to have a lawyer present. Counsel next considers whether Keith could argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to bar additional child-pornography images from being shown to the jury under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Counsel suggests that the child-pornography images were overly prejudicial, especially since Keith had offered to stipulate to their content. But offers of stipulation are not persuasive in the context of child-pornography prosecutions, see, e.g., United States v. McCourt, 468 F.3d 1088, 1091-92 (8th Cir.2006); United States v. Campos, 221 F.3d 1143, 1149 (10th Cir.2000). Relevant evidence “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,” Fed.R.Evid. 403, but evidence should not be excluded merely because it might be “graphic or disturbing,” United States v. Kapp, 419 F.3d 666, 667 (7th Cir.2005). Here the images were probative because they showed Keith’s possession of child — pornography images and his knowledge of possessing such images. Given that the government showed the jury only 32 of the 4,242 images found on Keith’s computer- and those images were shown for a limited time period — we would conclude, as have other circuits in similar cases, that the court appropriately found that the risk of prejudice did not substantially outweigh the images’ probative value. See United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, 607 F.3d 720, 734 (11th Cir.2010); United States v. Polouizzi, 564 F.3d 142, 152-53 (2d Cir.2009); United States v. Ganoe, 538 F.3d 1117,-1123-24 (9th Cir.2008); United States v. Morales-Aldahondo, 524 F.3d 115, 119-20 (1st Cir.2008); McCourt, 468 F.3d at 1091-93. We agree with counsel that a Rule 403 challenge would be frivolous. Counsel also considers but correctly rejects arguing that the evidence was insufficient to convict Keith of all counts charged in the indictment. We would affirm the judgment based on the sufficiency of evidence “if any rational jury could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Wortman, 488 F.3d 752, 754-55 (7th Cir.2007); see United States v. Muick, 167 F.3d 1162, 1166 (7th Cir.1999). On the child-pornography charges, 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(2)(A), (a)(5)(B), a rational jury could have found sufficient evidence because witnesses testified that Keith admitted to using Limewire to download and share child pornography, and witnesses identified images recovered from his computers. Moreover, experts in computer forensics testified that images found on Keith’s computers depicted known victims of child molestation and sexual abuse, and *508a pediatrician opined that the persons depicted were minors. On the destruction-of-evidence charge, id. § 1519, a rational jury could have found sufficient evidence because agents testified that Keith admitted to deleting and moving files from his laptop onto a flash drive upon seeing agents approach his house. Also, forensic evidence showed that files were deleted from Keith’s computer just minutes after the agents’ arrival, and agents testified that, upon entering the house, they saw Keith using his computer. Keith maintains in his Rule 51(b) response that there was insufficient evidence for conviction because he never made statements to agents, that other people used the computers, that any downloaded images were accidents, and that he did not intend to destroy evidence. But a reasonable jury could disagree, and we would not reweigh the evidence or second-guess the jury’s determinations about the witnesses’ credibility. See United States v. Green, 648 F.3d 569, 578 (7th Cir.2011). Turning to his sentence, Keith asserts in his Rule 51(b) response that the district court erred by not adequately considering his argument that he deserved a lower sentence for providing care for his ill parents and brother. But this argument would be frivolous. His 240-month sentence was already below the properly-calculated guidelines range of 292 to 365 months and thus presumptively reasonable, Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 341, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); United States v. Poetz, 582 F.3d 835, 837 (7th Cir.2009), and sentencing courts may freely reject without discussion “stock arguments” like the one Keith made about his family situation. United States v. Martinez, 520 F.3d 749, 753 (7th Cir.2008) (internal citation omitted). At any rate, Keith mentioned his caregiving responsibilities at the end of his allocution, and the court sufficiently explained why it would not be swayed: “Maybe you have been a caregiver, but you sure spent a lot of time on the computer violating the law while you were doing it.” Accordingly, we GRANT counsel’s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal. Keith’s motion for appointment of substitute counsel is DENIED as moot.","volume":"440","reporter":"F.

CATLIOTA, Bankruptcy Judge. La Union Center LLC (the “Movant”) seeks dismissal of this Chapter 11 case claiming that debtor Jin Suk Kim Trust (the “Debtor”) is not eligible to file a bankruptcy petition because it is not a “business trust.” The Debtor opposes the dismissal motion. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court concludes that the Debt- or is a “business trust” as that term is *699used in 11 U.S.C. § 101(9)(A)(v) and therefore will deny the motion to dismiss. FINDINGS OF FACT On or about January 1, 1993, Jin Heang Chung executed the Irrevocable Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”) thereby creating the Jin Suk Kim Trust (the “Debtor”). Jin Heang Chung was the grantor (the “Grantor” and also referred to at times as “her mother”). The Trust Agreement named Jin Suk Kim, the Grantor’s daughter (“Kim”), as the trustee and life income beneficiary. Kim has been the only person designated as the trustee under the Trust Agreement although, as explained more fully below, Robert Harris signed documents as the “Trustee” for a short period prior to 2009. The Debtor was established to be a generation skipping trust that allowed the original trust corpus to be passed on to the beneficiaries named by Kim in her will while (supposedly) providing income to Kim, the Grantor’s only child. The facts in the foregoing sentence were established by the testimony of Movant’s expert, Mark Feinberg. The Trust Agreement does not contain a statement of purpose other than to state that the transfer is made for “the uses and purposes” set forth therein, and that the trustee “shall collect the income arising from the principal ... [and] shall dispose of income and principal” in accordance with the Trust Agreement. Ex. 3 at 1. No one, including the Grantor, ever had any discussions with Kim about the purpose of the Debtor or why it was created. No one explained to her the duties or obligations of a trustee, or whether she should operate the Debtor any differently than she operated her other businesses. No evidence was introduced by any party as to who is named in Kim’s will, although it seems quite apparent that it will be Kim’s family members. Kim, whom the Court found to be entirely credible,1 had no real understanding of why her mother created the Debtor. Further, these matters were not particularly important to her, because her focus has been on building wealth in the Debtor for the benefit of her family as a whole. The Trust Agreement provided that Kim, the trustee, “shall pay” to herself “all of the net income of the trust....” Ex. 3 at ¶ 2. In addition, Kim also was authorized to pay to herself such sums from the principal of the trust estate hereunder as the Trustees, in their sole discretion, may deem necessary or advisable for her support and health, or to maintain her in the standard of living to which she has been accustomed. Id. In fact, Kim never made any distributions of net income or principal to herself (or anyone else, for that matter), instead retaining and reinvesting all profits so as to maximize the value of the Debtor’s assets and enable the Debtor to acquire additional real estate investments, as described herein.2 The Trust Agreement gave Kim, the trustee, broad powers to invest the Debt- *700or’s assets as she saw fit and provided her substantial protection from liability for losses: [the Trustee is not] limited to the class of investments permitted by any statute, law or rule of court relating to the investment in trust funds, and the Trustee shall not be required to diversify the investments of the trust property except to such extent as they deem advisable. ****** The trustee, while acting in good faith, shall not be liable or held responsible for any loss or depreciation in the value of the trust property resulting from any of the investments or reinvestments made by them. Trust Agreement, ¶ 6. Kim has been in the real estate business since 1980, managing and investing in real estate owned directly with her husband, in limited liability companies or in the Debt- or. Kim managed the Debtor the way she managed her other real estate investments. Her goal was to make the best business decisions she could make, after consulting with her mother and husband, in order to maximize the Trust’s profits and the value of its assets. She operated the Debtor as a family real estate enterprise with the intention of maximizing family wealth, and fairly aggressively leveraged the initial real estate investment that was transferred to the Debtor in order to acquire additional real estate investments. Her actions were not reckless by the measure of a real estate investor, and were allowed by the Trust Agreement, but they were not consistent with a fiduciary’s obligation to prudently protect and preserve the res of a trust. Six years before the Debtor was created, in March 1987, the Grantor, Kim and her husband purchased the Mattapony Shopping Center (the “Mattapony Center”) in Prince George’s County, Maryland—the Grantor acquired a ninety percent interest while Kim and her husband each acquired a five percent interest. Kim managed the Mattapony Center for the Grantor, herself and her husband upon its acquisition in 1987. Upon the Debtor’s creation, the Grantor transferred into the Debtor her ninety percent interest in the Mattapony Center. Kim and her husband retained their collective ten percent interest in the Mattapony Center, although, as explained below, the economic value of those interests eventually made their way into the Debtor. Kim continued to manage the Mattapo-ny Center after the Grantor transferred her interest into the Debtor in the same way she managed it before the Debtor was created. Specifically, she discussed proposed actions with her mother and husband and took actions designed to maximize the profit from and value of the asset. In 1994, Kim purchased on behalf of the Debtor a shopping center in Fredericks-burg, Virginia (the “Fredericksburg Center”) from Carl Silver. She saw an advertisement that stated the Fredericksburg Center could be acquired for $1.9 million with only a $100,000 down payment, and the rents from the center would be sufficient to service the debt. She thought it was a “good deal.” Before she bought it she discussed the acquisition with her mother. The down payment came from retained profits from the Mattapony Center, and the balance of the purchase price was funded by a deed of trust loan from Eagle Bank and a note that the seller took back. Significantly, the seller’s note was secured by a deed of trust against the Mattapony Center. Ex. 5 at 1. In January 2003, the Debtor, Kim and her husband executed a deed of trust on the Mattapony Center to secure a personal obligation of Kim and her husband to *701Greenpoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. Ex. 7 at 1 (“Borrowers Hiun Ung Kim and Jim Suk Kim owe Lender the aggregate principal sum ... as evidenced by a promissory note from Borrowers Hiun Ung Kim and Jim Suk Kim... .”). On May 1, 2006, Kim acquired on behalf of the Debtor La Union Mall (“La Union Mall”) in Prince Georges’s County, Maryland for $12,657,000. The transaction was structured as a like-kind exchange under § 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, pursuant to which the Debtor sold the Mattapony Center and the Fredericks-burg Center through the like-kind exchange mechanism in order to provide the down payment for La Union Mall. In addition to the Debtor’s down payment, the acquisition was financed by a first deed of trust loan in the amount of $9,100,000 from Virginia Commerce Bank, and an approximately $2.3 million second deed of trust loan from KF Funding Company. KH Funding also made an approximately $2 million loan to the Debtor for improvements. Thus, in round numbers, the amount of equity the Debtor used to acquire La Union Mall was approximately $1,300,000 ($12,657,000 minus $9,100,000, from the first deed of trust, minus $2,300,000, from the second deed of trust) and the loan-to-value ratio of the first and second deed of trust loans against the purchase price exceeded 90%. Taking into account the $2 million improvements loan made by KH Funding, the total secured and unsecured debt incurred by the Debtor in the transaction exceeded the purchase price by $700,000. The deed reflects that La Union Mall is titled solely in the name of the Debtor. It appears from the documents admitted into evidence that 100% of the like-kind exchange proceeds from the Mattapony Center went into the acquisition of La Union Mall. The Court therefore finds that Kim’s and her husband’s five percent interests in the Mattapony Center were used in the Debtor’s acquisition of La Union Mall. Further, notwithstanding that La Union Mall is titled strictly in the Debtor’s name, Kim and her husband are personally obligated on the Virginia Commerce Bank loan, along with the Debtor. Ex. 9 at p. KIM003276. Prior to the acquisition of La Union Mall, Kim managed the Debtor. When KH Funding made its loan in the La Union Mall transaction, it began to manage the Debtor’s real estate. Robert Harris, an executive with KH Funding, signed documents and took actions on behalf of the Debtor using the title of “Trustee” of the Debtor, but he has never been appointed as trustee. See, e.g., Ex. 21 at 20. In December, 2009, Kim, her husband and the Debtor, as borrowers, entered into a loan modification agreement with Virginia Commerce Bank. Ex. 14. An “integral part” of the loan modification agreement was that the Debtor would terminate KH Funding from doing anything associated with managing the Debtor. Id. at ¶ 13. Mr. Harris no longer signed documents as “Trustee” of the Debtor. The Debtor directly employs twelve employees, six who provide security for the real estate operations and six who perform maintenance services. The Debtor contracts directly with service providers and tenants at La Union Mall. The Debtor has no formal board of directors or officers. It was never registered with the state of Maryland as a business trust or a statutory trust. It does not hold a certificate of trust nor does the beneficiary hold a certificate of ownership. The Debtor commenced this case on March 1, 2011, by filing a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The *702Debtor is operating as debtor-in-possession pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 1107 and 1108. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1384, 157(a), and Local Rule 402 of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. This is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 157(b)(2)(A). CONCLUSIONS OF LAW Section 109(d) of the United States Bankruptcy Code3 provides that “[o]nly a ... person that may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title ... may be a debtor under chapter 11....” 11 U.S.C. § 109(d). The term “person” includes “individual, partnership, and corporation.” 11 U.S.C. § 101(41). The term “corporation” includes a “business trust.” 11 U.S.C. § 101(9)(A)(v). Thus, a “business trust” is eligible under § 109(d) to file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. But a personal, family or testamentary trust&emdash; the primary purpose of which is to provide for the maintenance of the trust beneficiaries&emdash;is not eligible. In re Hurst Trust, No. 97-14562-PM, 1997 WL 412168, *3-4, 1997 Bankr.LEXIS 997, at *9 (Bankr. D.Md. June 19, 1997). Accordingly, the Court must determine whether the Debtor is a business trust as that term is used in § 101(9)(A)(v). Numerous cases have addressed the issue of what constitutes a business trust under § 101(9)(A)(v). Two circuit courts of appeal have done so, as have a number of bankruptcy courts within the Fourth Circuit. However, no uniform standard has emerged and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has not addressed the issue. The Sixth Circuit developed the “primary purpose” test to determine whether a trust is a business trust. The test consists of two propositions: First, “trusts created with the primary purpose of transacting business or carrying on commercial activity for the benefit of investors qualify as business trusts, while trusts designed merely to preserve the trust res for beneficiaries generally are not business trusts,” and second, “the determination is fact-specific, and it is imperative that bankruptcy courts make thorough and specific findings of fact to support their conclusions”&emdash;findings, that is, regarding what was the intention of the parties, and how the trust operated. In re Kenneth Allen Knight Trust (Knight Trust), 303 F.3d 671, 680 (6th Cir.2002) (internal citations omitted). The court in Knight Trust first concluded that the “definition of business trust properly belongs to federal, rather than state, law,” id. at 679, because to “hold otherwise would result in different results in different states and an entity would be eligible for relief in one state but not another.” Id. (quoting In re Arehart, 52 B.R. 308, 310-11 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1985)). The court next recognized that a number of court-made definitions of “business trust” exist and “indeed perhaps the only thing all cases have in common is the recognition that they all differ.” Id. In adopting the primary purpose test, the court determined it to be “reasonably clear and workable, and reflects the intent of Congress.” Id. at 680. The court upheld the bankruptcy court’s determination that the trust was a business trust, relying on the bankruptcy court’s findings that the grantor/trustee treated the trust as he did all the other *703business entities, id. at 674-75, and that the primary purpose of the trust was to transact business for the benefit of the grantor, the investor, and not merely to preserve the trust res for the beneficiaries. Id at 680. In formulating the primary purpose test, the court held that neither transferable certificates of ownership, nor the trust’s business activity being for profit are necessary requirements in determining whether a trust is a business trust. Id. at 676-77. The Second Circuit in In re Secured Equipment Trust of Eastern Air Lines, Inc. (Secured Equipment), 38 F.3d 86, 89 (2d Cir.1994) determined that a court must analyze several factors to find whether a trust is a business trust, with the first factor being whether the trust has attributes of a corporation. Next, a court must determine whether the trust was created “for the purpose of carrying on some kind of business,” or whether the purpose was “to protect and preserve the res.” Id. Then a court must consider whether the trust engages in business-like activities, although while a trust “must engage in business-like activities to qualify as a business trust, such activity, without more, does not necessarily demonstrate that a trust is a business trust.” Id. Finally, the court must consider whether the trust provides benefits to the beneficiaries, which are not limited to profits. Id. at 90. The “presence or absence of a profit motive [is] influential” in determining the existence of a business trust. Id. Ultimately, Secured Equipment held that there is no definitive list of characteristics, and that eventually, “each decision is based on a very fact-specific analysis of the trust at issue.” Id. at 89; See also In re Happy Trust Three, 122 Fed.Appx. 527, 528 (2d Cir.2004) (court found that the trust never engaged in business activities, never turned a profit, did not presently and was unlikely to engage in business activities in the future, and was thus not a business trust). Furthermore, even though the Secured Equipment trust qualified as a business trust under New York corporate law because it was an association that operated a business under a written instrument, and the beneficial interests were divided into shares, the court held that its focus must be on the trust documents and the totality of the circumstances, and not solely on whether a trust engages in business activities. Secured Equipment at 91. Here, looking solely at the Trust Agreement, the matter is not so clear. The Trust Agreement on its face provides for income to Kim for life and allows Kim to determine who would receive the Debt- or’s assets through her will. Trusts that are designed to provide income to a beneficiary for life while preserving the trust res for future beneficiaries “generally” are not business trusts. Knight Trust, at 680. However, the Trust Agreement gives Kim virtually unfettered discretion to invest the Debtor’s assets as she sees fit without regard to any rules of diversification, and insulates her from liability for any actions taken in good faith. It allows Kim to take all assets from the Debtor at any time, in her sole discretion, limited only to the extent advisable “for her support and health, or to maintain her in the standard of living to which she has been accustomed.” Trust Agreement, ¶ 6. The Movant’s expert’s testimony was not especially probative on the issue. He testified that there are two reasons a party would use a trust, as opposed to a corporate entity. The first often arises in family situations, where there is a concern about the maturity of the beneficiary, and the grantor names an independent trustee to manage the trust property. This reason would be significant under Knight *704Trust if the record establishes that the trustee functions primarily to protect and preserve the res for future beneficiaries. But this reason has little significance here, because the record did not establish that the Debtor was established or is operated for this reason. The second reason is tax planning. It is clear from the expert’s testimony that tax planning was the motivating factor behind the creation of the Debtor. But tax planning alone does not establish whether the trust is created for a business or a profit purpose or to protect and preserve the rest. No case of which this Court is aware looked solely to the formation document in reaching a determination. The one overriding principle that emerges from the cases is that the determination of whether a trust is a business trust is fact-specific and focuses on the purpose and operations of the trust. Under this broader view, the Court concludes the Debtor is a business trust. As set forth in the Findings of Fact, from the moment of its inception, Kim managed the Debtor to maximize its profits and the value of its assets in order to enhance the overall wealth of her family. She managed it, and the real estate assets it acquired, the same way she ran her other businesses, without regard to trust principles, including traditional trust principles of prudent, diversified investment and protection of trust res. She did not pay to the income beneficiary (ie., herself) any income from the Debtor, instead reinvesting it to maximize the Debtor’s value. As the following facts establish, Kim used the Debtor’s initial real estate investment in Mattapony Center to acquire additional real estate investments in order to maximize the Debtor’s value. While the Court would not conclude Kim’s actions were reckless, they were not consistent with a fiduciary’s obligation to prudently protect and preserve the res of a trust. • Kim purchased on behalf of the Debt- or the Fredericksburg Center with a minimal amount of down payment and a traditional deed of trust loan, but also with the seller taking back a note secured by the Mattapony Center. • Kim secured personal obligations of her and her husband for investment purposes with Debtor’s assets. ® The acquisition of La Union Mall was a highly leveraged transaction, with an initial secured loan-to-value ratio of 90% and total secured and unsecured debt that exceeded the purchase price by $700,000. • The deed reflects that La Union Mall is titled solely in the name of the Debtor, and it appears that Kim’s and her husband’s five percent interests in the Mattapony Center were used in the Debtor’s acquisition of La Union Mall. • Kim is and has been personally obligated on a number of the Debtor’s loan obligations, and there would no need for a trustee to guaranty trust obligations if the purpose of the Debt- or was to protect and preserve the trust res. • Although Kim’s husband has no beneficial interest in the Debtor on the record before the Court, he is personally obligated on a number of the Debtor’s obligations. The Court concludes that the purpose of the Debtor was to transfer the economic interest of ninety percent of the Mattapo-ny Center to Kim from her mother, in a manner that resulted in tax benefits, but which was intended to allow Kim to continue to manage the Mattapony Center and any other assets the Debtor acquired the same as she operated her other real estate ventures. It also allowed Kim to realize *705the value from the transfer if she chose while continuing to expand her real estate business as she saw fit. The Court concludes the Debtor is a business trust. Movant cites to this Court’s opinion in In re Mortgage Banking Trust (Nash), 2008 WL 3126186 (Bankr.D.Md.2008), to support its contention that the Debtor is not a business trust. But a comparison of the Nash trust and the Debtor illustrates the importance of the detailed fact-findings required by both the Sixth and Second Circuits as necessary to determine the true purposes and operations of the trust. The Nash trust was established along with several other trusts as part of the grant- or’s marital and estate planning, and its purpose was to “hold certain property, and to provide for the maintenance, care, comfort and support of [the grantor and his] beneficiaries....” Id. at *1. Of critical distinction, the Nash trust, in both its purpose and operation, was intended to protect prudently the trust res for beneficiaries. Finally, Movant argues that the Debtor does not qualify as a statutory business trust under Maryland law. But this Court adopts the view of Knight Trust that “definition of business trust properly belongs to federal, rather than state, law.” Knight Trust at 679. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons the Court will deny the motion to dismiss. An order will follow. . Kim speaks very broken English. Nevertheless she communicates in English well enough that the Court was able to understand her testimony fully. . In 2006, while KH Funding acted as property manager, it made a distribution to Kim, apparently in her personal capacity as income beneficiary. Kim forgot completely about this distribution and did not recall it at the time of her deposition, but raised it at trial to clarify the record. The Court finds no significance in the fact that there may have been one distribution to Kim in 2006, considering the 18 years existence of the Debtor, and considering the distribution was not made by Kim herself. .

Markem-Imaje Corp. sued Zipher Ltd. and Videojet Technologies, Inc. (together “Zipher”) in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, requesting a declaratory judgment that Zipher’s U.S. Patent No. 7,150,572 (the '572 patent) is not infringed by Markem. The district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement,1 and Zipher appeals. We conclude that the district court erred in construing a critical claim term; thus the summary judgment of non-infringement is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings on the corrected claim construction. The Patented Invention The '572 patent, entitled “Tape Drive and Printing Apparatus,” describes and claims a device for transfer printing. In transfer printing, ink is carried by a ribbon that is moved into contact with the substrate to be printed, and a print head impresses upon the ribbon and causes the ink to transfer from the ribbon to the substrate. In thermal transfer printing, the print head is heated, facilitating transfer and adherence of the ink to the substrate. Thermal transfer printers are used for such tasks as printing on plastic packaging and other surfaces to which ink does not readily adhere. In systems where the thermal printing is part of a mechanized and automated process, the printing step must keep pace with the production line, with minimal down time. The '572 patent is directed to a heat transfer printing apparatus that provides increased control over the acceleration, de*1281celeration, speed, and positional accuracy of the printing operation, while minimizing waste of unused portions of the ink ribbon. In transfer printers in general, the ink ribbon is wound on two spools, one spool for supplying the ribbon for positioning on the substrate, and the other spool for taking up the ribbon after use. The '572 patent explains that prior art transfer printers rely upon a wide range of different approaches to the problem of how to drive the ribbon spools. Some rely upon stepper motors, others on DC motors to directly or indirectly drive the spools. Generally the known arrangements drive only the spool onto which ribbon is taken up (the take-up spool) and rely upon some form of “slipping clutch” arrangement on the spool from which ribbon is drawn (the supply spool) to provide a resistive force so as to ensure that the ribbon is maintained in tension during the printing and ribbon winding processes and to prevent ribbon overrun when the ribbon is brought to rest. '572 patent col.1 11.33-44. The patent states that “It will be appreciated that maintaining adequate tension is an essential requirement for proper functioning of the printer.” Id. col.l 11.44-46. The '572 patent is directed to an improvement in controlling the movement and tension of the ribbon. Figure 1 of the '572 patent shows the two ribbon spools 7 and 11, with ribbon 6 extending between them and passing under the print head at 4: Y_ Housing ---1 The patent specification explains the problems with the “slipping clutch” that has been used to provide ribbon tension in prior art printers. A slipping clutch provides a constant resistive torque to the supply spool, and the constant torque causes the tension in the ribbon to vary as the supply spool outer diameter changes with the draw of ribbon. The patent states that such dynamically changing ribbon tension requires tight tolerances in clutch force, which is difficult to maintain because wear in the clutch tends to change the resistive force of the clutch. Too much clutch force can break the ribbon or require more power to drive the ribbon, and *1282too little clutch force can cause the supply spool to overrun. The patent states: “Given these constraints, typical printer designs have compromised performance by way of limiting the rate of acceleration, the rate of deceleration, and the maximum speed capability of the ribbon transport system. Overall printer performance has as a result been compromised.” Id. col.1 1.66-C01.2 1.4. Examples of conventional clutch or drag-type drive mechanisms are discussed in the '572 patent, including mechanisms in which, instead of a slipping clutch, a motor connected to the supply spool supplies a resistive force to provide ribbon tension. In another prior apparatus, a motor coupled to the supply spool “aet[s] as a feedback transducer to enable appropriate control of the motor driving the take-up spool to take account of changing spool diameters while maintaining a constant ribbon speed.” Id. col.2 11.39-42. The '572 patent distinguishes this prior apparatus from what the '572 patent calls the “push-pull” mechanism of the '572 apparatus, explaining that although this [prior art] arrangement does avoid the need for example of a capstan drive interposed between the two spools so as to achieve reliable ribbon delivery speeds, only one of the motors is driven to deliver torque to assist ribbon transport. There is no suggestion that the apparatus can operate in push-pull mode, that is the motor driving the take-up spool operating to pull the ribbon and the motor driving the supply spool operating to push the associated spool in a direction which assists tape transport. Id. col.2 11.43-51. In accordance with the “push-pull” mode of the '572 patent, both the take-up spool and the supply spool are driven to particular angular positions by stepper motors that receive commands from a microcontroller. The take-up spool rotates and takes up a given length of ribbon per rotation, while the supply spool is rotated to feed out the same length of ribbon, independent of the constantly changing spool diameter. Such an arrangement is not provided in the prior devices, and is described as solving various problems encountered with prior devices. As described in the '572 patent, stepper motors rotate by selectively energizing electromagnets around the outside of the motor, referred to as the “stator,” to interact with permanent magnets or electromagnets on the shaft or “rotor” of the motor. Id. col.20 11.38-41. Unlike DC (direct current) motors, which are analog devices that simply rotate when power is supplied, stepper motors have discrete angular positions or “steps” and can be forced or driven to stay in particular step positions. Zipher’s expert witness, Professor Kuc, explained that an advantage of a stepper motor is that “when it’s still, it’s got a holding torque to keep the ribbon in place.” Hearing Tr. 40:21-23 (J.A. 340). The holding torque results from the electromagnetic attraction between poles of the rotor and poles of the stator in an energized stepper motor at rest. When an external torque (resulting from tension in the print ribbon) is applied to the spools, these electromagnetic forces create an opposing torque to keep the motor in its current angular position, thereby maintaining tension in the print ribbon. If the motor’s maximum holding torque is exceeded by the external torque, the motor shaft will rotate; thus “holding torque” also specifies the minimum amount of external torque needed to rotate the shaft of a stepper motor commanded to hold steady in its current position. Markem’s expert witness, Peter Landers, agreed with Zipher’s expert that when power is applied to a stepper motor it is held in *1283position so that even when the spool of the printer is not rotating it will “hold the [ribbon] tension to the level it was set before.” Hearing Tr. 21:6-23:1 (J.A. 321-23). The '572 patent describes optically monitoring the radii of the spools and using the data “to calculate the step rate and the number of steps required by each motor to drive the spools in an appropriate manner so as to feed the ribbon a predetermined distance.” Col.20 11.25-28. The patent explains that “[t]ension in the ribbon between the two spools must however be closely controlled to avoid the tension becoming too high (resulting in over tightening of the ribbon on the spools or even ribbon breakage) or the tension becoming too low (resulting in loss of positional control as a result of the ribbon becoming slack).” Id. col.19 11.32-38. The '572 patent describes its method of estimating ribbon tension (í), and explains how tension is maintained within predetermined limits: If the derived value of t is too high (above a predetermined limit), then a small step adjustment can be made to either or both of the motors to add a short section of ribbon to the length of ribbon between the spools. If the derived value of t is too low (below a different predetermined limit), then a short section of ribbon can be removed from the length of ribbon between the spools.... [M]athematical processing results in a “correction” amount of ribbon that needs to be added to or removed from the ribbon path between the spools during the next ribbon feed. This addition or removal of ribbon maintains ribbon tension within acceptable limits. Id. col.22 11.16-42. Claim 1, the broadest claim of the '572 patent, is directed to a tape drive that corrects tension divergences from the predetermined limit in this manner: 1. A tape drive comprising: two motors, at least one of which is a stepper motor; two tape spool supports on which spools of tape are mounted, each spool being driveable by a respective one of said motors; a controller adapted to control energization of said two motors such that tape is transported in at least one direction between spools of tape mounted on the spool supports; wherein the controller energizes both said motors to drive the spools in a tape transport direction, and said controller calculates a length of tape to be added to or subtracted from tape extending between said spools in order to maintain tension in said tape between predetermined limit values and controls said motors to drive the spools to add or subtract the calculated length of tape to or from the tape extending between said spools. Following a claim construction hearing, the district court construed “driveable” and “drive” to mean “rotateable” and “rotate,” as proposed by Markem, rejecting Zipher’s broader construction. Markem, 2008 WL 4116666, at *11. The district court explained in its reconsideration opinion that the use of the plural word “spools” in the claim clause “to drive the spools to add or subtract the calculated length of tape” means that both spools must rotate. Markem, 2009 WL 2855011, at *1. The court further explained that both spools must rotate to add or subtract a single calculated length of tape. Markem-Imaje, 2010 WL 114947, at *1. The operation of Markem’s accused devices was not disputed, as the district court explained: Although Markem’s tape drives rotate both spools during the tape tension ad*1284justment process, only a single spool is rotated to achieve each adjustment. If tape tension is too low, the take-up spool is rotated to decrease the length of tape between the spools and if tape tension is too high, the supply spool is rotated to increase the length of tape between the spools. Id. Based on the district court’s ruling that the term “drive” in the '572 claims requires that both spools are rotated together to adjust the tape, the court granted summary judgment of non-infringement. Zipher appeals, stating that the judgment was based on an erroneous claim construction. Discussion Claim construction receives plenary review on appeal. Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1456 (Fed.Cir. 1998) (en banc). The grant of summary judgment also receives plenary review. I Zipher argues that the district court erred in limiting the claim phrase “drive the spools” to mean “rotate the spools.” Zipher argues that “drive” in this phrase has the inclusive meaning of not only rotate but also “hold steady in a commanded position.” The district court acknowledged that the ordinary meaning of “drive” can be broad enough to encompass not only the rotation of the spools but also application of a holding torque that prevents the spool from rotating. Markem, 2008 WL 4116666, at *3 & n. 4. The district court observed that “[m]ost of the references to driving the spools in the specification could accommodate either proposed construction;” that is, “drive” could mean applying only rotational torque, or it could also include application of a holding torque. Id. at *6. However, the court found that other usages in the specification support limiting “drive” to mean only the narrower “rotate” and concluded that “when the specification uses ‘drive’ to refer to the spools, it supports Markem’s narrower construction of rotating the spools rather than merely controlling them.” Id. at *7. The district court reasoned that giving “drive” a meaning broader than “rotation” in the final clause of the claim (the tension control clause) would be contradictory to the meaning of “drive” in the tape transport clause, which states that “the controller energizes both said motors to drive the spools in a tape transport direction.” Markem states that Zipher conceded that “drive the spools in a tape transport direction” means that both spools are rotated in the tape transport direction. Markem stresses that “claim terms are normally used consistently throughout the patent,” Phillips v. AWH Coip., 415 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc), and that “a claim term should be construed consistently with its appearance in other places in the same claim or in other claims of the same patent.” Id. (quoting Rexnord Corp. v. Laitram Corp., 274 F.3d 1336, 1342 (Fed.Cir.2001)). Thus, according to Markem, “drive” requires that the spool “rotate,” for example in the claim clause “controls said motors to drive the spools to add or subtract the calculated length of tape.” Zipher argues that this construction would exclude the holding torque function that is necessary to accomplish the tension correction described in the specification, see '572 patent col.22 11.17-19 (stating that if tension is too high “a small step adjustment can be made to either or both of the motors to add a short section of ribbon”). The district court determined that because the claim clause “controls said motors to drive the spools” already used the word “control,” the patentee could not have intended “control” and “drive” to mean the same thing. The court declined *1285to view the claim clause “each spool being driveable by a respective one of said motors” to include driving to control tape movement or torque. The district court pointed to a passage in the specification which states that prior art devices “drive only the spool onto which ribbon is taken up,” '572 patent col.l 11.37-38, suggesting that a supply spool controlled by a slipping clutch is not driven. The district court concluded that “drive” cannot mean “apply torque” or else the specification would not have stated that “only” the supply spool is driven. See Markem, 2008 WL 4116666, at *6. Thus the court concluded that the patentee intended a narrow interpretation of “drive” in the claim, excluding the role of applying torque to a spool to hold it in place. Zipher argues that the term “drive” has a meaning similar to that of “control,” and is not limited to rotation motion. We agree that “drive” need not be narrowly construed merely because a broader construction would make it similar to the word “control” that is also used in the claim. Nothing in the specification or the overall invention as presented in the claim and as argued to the patent examiner requires the narrow construction. The district court also cited a passage where “the specification describes a circumstance in which the take-up motor is energized to rotate and the supply motor is de-energized.” Id. The '572 patent states that if motor 92 is pulling, the drive circuit 108 for that motor is enabled and therefore the rotation angle for the spool being driven (94) is known. The drive circuit for the motor being pulled (93) is disabled (line 104 low). Thus motor 93 acts as a generator and a back-emf is generated across each of the motor windings 97 to 100. '572 patent col.23 11.35-40. The court concluded that “the fact that only the take-up spool is described as being ‘driven’ suggests that driving a spool means actively rotating it, not passively or indirectly controlling its motion.” Markem, 2008 WL 4116666, at *6. However, the cited passage in the specification does not limit “driving” to rotation, or negate the substance of the invention, which requires that separate motors control the movement of the spools as appropriate to provide torque and tension. All that the cited passage suggests is that a de-energized motor that does not provide drag is not driving a spool. The specification does not suggest that an energized motor actively applying torque to either rotate a spool or hold it steady does not “drive” the spool. Zipher points out that the motor functions in the specification “include[ ] rotating, holding steady, stopping, accelerating, decelerating, and all the other drive functions the motors perform,” Zipher Br. 44. The term “drive” is used throughout the specification in connection with the motor control of the spools. It is not inconsistent for “drive the spools in a tape transport direction” to mean “apply torque to cause rotation,” and for “drive the spools” to mean “apply torque to the spools.” The district court acknowledged that “drive” can include the application of torque, and the specification uses “drive” to encompass both rotation and torque applied to the spools. The specification does not support the district court’s conclusion that to “drive” the spools means only to provide rotational torque. Both parties argue that the prosecution history favors their position. The district court concluded that the prosecution history “does not cut strongly in either direction.” Markem, 2008 WL 4116666, at *11. The district court discussed that the claim that became claim 1 of the patent (claim 68 of the application) was initially dependent on claims 64 and 65 of the *1286application, which recited that the controller energized the motors “so as to push-pull drive the spools in a tape transport direction.” Id. at *8 & n. 8. Claims 64 and 65 were rejected during prosecution as anticipated by U.S. Patent No. 5,366,303 (“Barrus”). In traversing this rejection, the applicant stated: In contrast to claim 64, Barrus et al energize one motor and de-energize the other motor for a pull-drag drive operation .... The push-pull limitation requires the controller to energize both motors to drive the spools. It is clear that in the configuration of Barrus et al the controller does not energize both motors to push-pull drive the spools of tape. Appl. No. 10/380,182, Amendment dated July 6, 2006, at 11 (J.A. 995). The examiner had found that claim 68 contained allowable subject matter because the prior art did not teach a tape drive that maintains tape tension “between upper and lower limit values and then controls the motors to add or subtract the calculated length of tape to the tape extending between the spools.” The applicant then rewrote claim 68 in independent form with some modifications including deletion of the “push-pull” term, and the examiner added an amendment in which “controls said motors to add or subtract the calculated length of tape” was changed to “controls said motors to drive the spools to add or subtract the calculated length of tape.” The examiner’s Summary states that the added language “more clearly defines the scope of claim 68.” Appl. No. 10/380,182, Examiner’s Interview Summary (Sept. 7, 2006) (J.A. 1019). We discern no indication that the added phrase “to drive the spools” in the examiner’s amendment was intended or understood to limit “drive” to “rotate,” for that was not an issue of examination. Rather, Zipher had distinguished Barrus as regulating tension by varying drag applied by a motor acting as a generator, and the examiner’s amendment reflects that distinction. The examiner’s amendment accords with the '572 patent’s requirement that the motors apply torque to the spools, whether the torque causes rotation or resists it. This active energization of the '572 patent’s motors is distinct from Barrus, where passive resistive torque is created by lowering the resistance in the output circuit of a motor acting as a generator. See Barrus eol.4 11.5-15. The prosecution history distinguishes the resistance drag of the second spool as in Barrus, and requires that “to drive the spools” includes both rotation torque and holding torque. The district court’s construction that “drive” requires that the supply spool must always rotate to control the tension is incorrect. II Zipher also appeals the district court’s construction that the claims require “some method of deriving a tension measurement,” Markem, 2008 WL 4116666, at *12. Markem had asked the district court to hold that “using a contactless means of tension measurement that occurs during the rotation of both motors is a necessary and inherent aspect of such measurement because the specification does not describe any other method of such measurement.” Id. The district court declined this request, but stated that “some method of deriving a tension measurement, whether directly or indirectly, is a necessary predicate to maintaining tension ‘between predetermined limit values.’ ” Id. The court reasoned that “[wjithout having a reasonable estimate of the current tape tension, it is not possible to identify whether the tension is approaching or exceeding the limit values.” Id. Zipher argues that the claim does not explicitly recite measuring tension, and that construing the claims to require ten*1287sion measurement would import a limitation into the claims from the specification and violate the mandate of Rambus Inc. v. Infineon Tech. AG that “the claims need not recite every component necessary to enable operation of a working device.” 318 F.3d 1081, 1093 (Fed.Cir.2003). We agree with Zipher. That a device will only operate if certain elements are included is not grounds to incorporate those elements into the construction of the claims. A claim to an engine providing motive power to a car should not be construed to incorporate a limitation for an exhaust pipe, though an engine may not function without one. Thus, though “some method of deriving a tension measurement” may be required to make a claimed device operational, it is not proper to incorporate that method into the claim construction. We therefore reverse the district court’s determination that the claims require “some method of deriving a tension measurement.” On our holding that “drive” is properly construed to mean the application of torque to the spools, whether the torque causes rotation or resists it, we vacate the judgment of non-infringement, and remand for determination of infringement on the corrected claim constructions.

I concur in Part I of the court’s decision. I would, however, affirm the district court’s finding that “some method of deriving a tension measurement, whether directly or indirectly, is a necessary predicate to maintaining tension ‘between predetermined values.’ ” As the district court reasoned, “[wjithout having a reasonable estimate of the current tape tension, it is not possible to identify whether the tension is approaching or exceeding the limit values.” Markem Corp. v. Zipher Ltd., 2008 WL 4116666, *12 (D.N.H. Aug. 28, 2008). The panel majority’s contrary result ignores the paramount importance of the specification in claim construction. See Retractable Techs., Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 653 F.3d 1296, 1305 (Fed.Cir.2011) (“In reviewing the intrinsic record to construe the claims, we strive to capture the scope of the actual invention, rather than ... allow the claim language to become divorced from what the specification conveys is the invention.”). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from Part II of the court’s decision. Claims do not stand alone, but rather, are part of a “fully integrated written instrument,” consisting of a specification that concludes with claims. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1315 (Fed.Cir. 2005) (en banc) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 978 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc)). As recognized by the Supreme Court, it “is fundamental that claims are to be construed in light of the specifications and both are to be read with a view to ascertaining the invention,” United States v. Adams, 383 U.S. 39, 49, 86 S.Ct. 708, 15 L.Ed.2d 572 (1966), and as stated by Judge Rich for this court, “the descriptive part of the specification aids in ascertaining the scope and meaning of the claims inasmuch as the words of the claims must be based on the description. The specification is, thus, the primary basis for construing the claims.” Standard Oil Co. v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 774 F.2d 448, 452 (Fed.Cir.1985). The specification “is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term,” Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1315 (quoting Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1996)), for the specification shows what the inventor actually invented. See Bass Pro Trademarks v. Cabela’s Inc., 485 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2007) (“Claims are construed to implement the invention described in the specification.”). *1288Where the specification clearly and consistently sets the scope of a disputed claim, that scope governs the construction of the claim. See On Demand Mach. Corp. v. Ingram Indus., Inc., 442 F.3d 1331, 1339-40 (Fed.Cir.2006) (“In general, the scope and outer boundary of claims is set by the patentee’s description of his invention.” (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1313-14)). This court has no authority to enlarge the scope of the patent beyond what the patentee described as its invention, notwithstanding my colleagues’ curious analogy to a car and its tailpipe. Maj. Op. at 1300-01. Where a limitation is placed in a claim by the specification, the claim must be construed to include the limitation. See, e.g., Honeywell Int’l Inc. v. Universal Avionics Sys. Corp., 488 F.3d 982, 990 (Fed.Cir. 2007) (construing the claim term “look ahead distance” to include a time limitation because “time is inherent in the calculation of ‘look ahead distance,’ ” as shown by the specification); Network Commerce, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 422 F.3d 1353, 1360 (Fed. Cir.2005) (limiting the term “download component” to a component capable of performing certain functions, based on the consistent usage in the specification). The claims cannot transcend the invention that entitles the inventor to a patent. See Topliff v. Topliff, 145 U.S. 156, 171, 12 S.Ct. 825, 36 L.Ed. 658 (1892) (“The object of the patent law is to secure to inventors a monopoly of what they have actually invented or discovered.... ”). My colleagues’ reliance on the “mandate” of Rambus Inc. v. Infineon Tech. AG, 318 F.3d 1081 (Fed.Cir.2003), is misguided, as “[a]ll rules of construction must be understood in terms of the factual settings that produced them, and applied in fidelity to their origins.” Modine Mfg. Co. v. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 75 F.3d 1545, 1551 (Fed.Cir.1996). In Rambus, the district court interpreted claim language requiring a response to a “read request” to mean that the “read request” must include address and control information. This court reversed, holding that the district court's construction conflicted with the specification, which indicated that the address and control information were part of the request packet, not the read request. 318 F.3d at 1091-93. By contrast, in this case the specification fully supports the district court’s construction. Although the claim does not explicitly include terms for measuring tension, the specification describes as the invention the maintaining of the ribbon tension (t) within a predetermined amount, and “mathematical processing” whereby the “addition or removal of ribbon maintains ribbon tension within acceptable limits.” U.S. Patent No. 7,150,572, eol.22 11.38-42. As the district court found, “some method of deriving a tension measurement, whether directly or indirectly” is required. Markem, 2008 WL 4116666, at *12. Simply put, the printer must be able to measure tension so that the controller can “calculate a length of tape to be added to or subtracted from tape extending between said spools in order to maintain tension in said tape between predetermined limit values.” '572 patent, claim 1. The specification states that “a measure of tape tension may be calculated by reference to a measure of motor step rate, the calibration data related to the step rate, and the power consumed by the motor,” and further, that a “measure of tension t may be calculated from the measures of power supplied to the two motors, measures of the spool radii, calibration factors for the two motors related to the step rate of the motors.” Id. at col.5 11.19-22, 30-34. Thus while the invention is flexible as to how tension is measured, and permits measurement through indirect methods, some method of measurement is contemplated and required, as found by the trial court. *1289From my colleagues’ flawed view of the law of claim construction, and their reversal of the trial court’s correct and well reasoned construction, I respectfully dissent.","volume":"657","reporter":"F.3d","page":"1279","cite_type":"1","ltree":"federal_supreme.federal_circuit","generated_summary":"Claims do not stand alone, but rather, are part of a “fully integrated written instrument,” consisting of a specification that concludes with claims.

Nos. 60, 66, & 80) PONSOR, District Judge. I. INTRODUCTION Plaintiff Joanne Brooks is the administratrix of the estate of her son, Jason *336Michael Houran. Plaintiff filed a complaint in December 2008, alleging wrongful death and negligence; wrongful death and malicious, wilful, wanton, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct; conscious pain and suffering; and strict liability. (Dkt. No. 1.) On February 2, 2010, for reasons that will become clear, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint to further clarify the defendants. (Dkt. No. 41, Am. Compl.) Defendants filed cross-claims for indemnity and contribution against each other, the specifics of which are not relevant to the proceeding currently before the court. (Dkt. Nos. 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, & 57.) The amended complaint lists as Defendants: Specialty Minerals, Inc. (Counts IIV); Minerals Technologies, Inc. (Counts V-VIII); Bemis Line Construction Company, Inc. and/or Bemis Enterprises (IX-XII); Bemis, LLC (Counts XIII-XVI); and Hawkeye Group, LLC (Counts XVII-XX). Before the court are a motion for summary judgment by Defendants Bemis Enterprises and Bemis Line Construction (Dkt. No. 60) and a motion for summary judgment by Defendants Bemis, LLC and Hawkeye, LLC (Dkt. No. 66). Prior to oral argument, the court was informed that the cross-motion for summary judgment by Defendants Bemis, LLC and Hawkeye, LLC (Dkt. No. 80) was no longer at issue. The court will accordingly deny it as moot. Additionally, Plaintiff has withdrawn her claims against Defendant Hawkeye, LLC (Counts XVII-XX) and her claims of strict liability against all parties (Counts IV, VIII, XII, XVI, XX). As such, the court will dismiss Counts TV, VIII, XII, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, and XX II. BACKGROUND Under the familiar summary judgment standard, the facts are recited in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, with all reasonable inferences drawn in that party’s favor. Klaucke v. Daly, 595 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.2010). A. The Accident. Specialty Minerals, Inc. (“SMI”) is the owner and operator of a limestone mine in Adams, Massachusetts (“Adams mine”). Jason Michael Houran, the decedent, was a laborer who worked for a company called Adams Trucking, which performed maintenance and clean-up work at the mine. On July 27, 2006, Houran was using a weed-whacker in an area of the mine called Substation 15 when he cut through a guy wire attached to a utility pole (“Pole 7”) and was fatally electrocuted. Houran was survived by his mother (Plaintiff) and his son, who was four years old at the time. B. Cause of Death. Plaintiffs liability expert, Dr. J. Duncan Glover, opined that the electrocution occurred because the “guy strain insulator” that covered a portion of the guy wire that connected Pole 7 to the ground was “not long enough to prevent the guy itself from coming into contact with the conductors and becoming energized.” (Dkt. No. 79, Ex. 7, Glover Rep. at 2.) Dr. Glover further opined that the electrocution would not have occurred if the guy wire had been properly insulated. (Id.) A bird’s-eye-view photograph of Pole 7 shows two transformers connected to the pole with a transformer primary wire, also called a conductor, running between them. (Dkt. No. 64, Ex. 9.) The guy wire runs from the ground, past this transformer primary wire, and connects above the transformers to Pole 7 at a location not in view in the photograph. The photograph shows that a portion of the guy wire was covered with insulation. The insulation did not reach to the portion of the guy *337wire that was located near the transformer primary wire. Accordingly, when Mr. Houran severed the guy wire with the weed-whacker, the wire sagged, and an uninsulated part of the guy wire came into contact with the conductor. (Dkt. No. 79, Ex. 7, Glover Rep. at 2.) The result was Mr. Houran’s electrocution and subsequent death. C. Pole 7. Located at Substation 15 is a pump house that powered a pump that discharged water out of the limestone quarry. The electricity was delivered to the pump via high voltage power lines that ended at Pole 7 at the pump house. Pole 7 held three transformers and was kept in place with a guy wire that attached from Pole 7 to an anchor in the ground. It is this wire that Houran hit with his weed-whacker. Defendant SMI hired Defendant Bemis Line Construction to install power lines in 1998, including Pole 7. Defendant Bemis Line Construction had completed this installation by January 1,1999. Four and a half years later, on June 27, 2003, Defendant SMI hired Defendant Bemis Line Construction to install electrical power service to a new quarry pump at the existing pump house at Substation 15. In December 2004, Defendant SMI hired Defendant Bemis Line Construction to investigate a power outage that seemed to have occurred as a result of a lightening strike at Substation 15. In its investigation, Defendant Bemis Line Construction determined that the transformers on Pole 7 needed to be replaced. On January 28, 2005, Defendant Bemis Line Construction replaced the transformers on Pole 7 with identical transformers in the same locations as those that it had originally installed in 1998. D. The Bends Companies. Organized in Vermont on January 25, 1984, by its president, Rodney Bemis, Defendant Bemis Line Construction was a family electrical business whose work consisted primarily of setting up high voltage utility poles and wires in rural areas. (Dkt. No. 74, Ex. 3, Bemis Aff. ¶ 6.) Most of the company’s work was for utility companies, but it was occasionally hired by private companies like SMI. (Id ¶ 7.) Defendant Bemis, LLC was organized on April 7, 2006, two months prior to the accident and more than one year after Bemis Line Construction did any work at Substation 15. (Dkt. No. 74, Ex. 4.) Bemis, LLC is a subsidiary of Hawkeye Holdings, LLC, which is located in New York. On April 14, 2006, Rodney Bemis entered into a Purchase Asset Agreement with Defendant Bemis, LLC. (Dkt. No. 74, Ex. 3, Bemis Aff. ¶ 4.) As part of the transaction, the name of Bemis Line Construction was changed to Bemis Enterprises, Inc. (Id ¶ 5.) Rodney Bemis has continued to work as an electrical utility contractor with Bemis, LLC. (Id ¶ 6.) III. DISCUSSION A. Legal Standard. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ.P. 56. The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine issues of material fact. The burden then shifts to the opposing party who must demonstrate that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in its favor based on the evidence. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). “A party opposing summary judgment must present definite, competent evidence to re*338but the motion.” Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., 219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). B. Motion for Summary Judgment by Defendant Bemis Line Construction/Bemis Enterprises (Dkt. No. 60). Defendants Bemis Line Construction and Bemis Enterprises (“Defendant Bemis”) have moved together for summary-judgment on the counts against them on the grounds that Massachusetts’ statute of repose bars Plaintiffs claims. Plaintiff, Defendants SMI and MTI, and Defendant Bemis, LLC, have opposed the motion. (Dkt. Nos. 69, 72, & 77.) Massachusetts General Laws ch. 260, section 2B, requires in relevant part that an action in tort for damages “arising out of any deficiency or neglect in the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property” shall commence no later than six years after “substantial completion of the improvement.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2B. “Simply put, after six years, the statute completely eliminates a cause of action against certain persons in the construction industry.” Klein v. Catalano, 386 Mass. 701, 437 N.E.2d 514, 516 (1982). Defendant Bemis argues that its installation of the power lines at Substation 15 in 1998 was an improvement and that Plaintiffs 2008 claims arise out of that installation and thus are time-barred. Plaintiff and co-Defendants assert in response that the installation was not an improvement and, alternatively, that the claims arise out of Defendant Bemis’s subsequent work on Pole 7 at Substation 15 in 2005. 1. Improvement. The law appears clear that Defendant Bemis’s original installation was an improvement. See Parent v. Stone & Webster Eng’g Corp., 408 Mass. 108, 556 N.E.2d 1009, 1011 (1990) (An improvement is “a permanent addition to or betterment of real property that enhances its capital value and that involves the expenditure of labor or money and is designed to make the property more useful or valuable as distinguished from ordinary repairs.”). Notwithstanding Plaintiffs argument that the attaching of a guy wire to a utility pole does not constitute an improvement, Defendant Bemis clearly falls into the class of protected actors who “perform acts of ‘individual expertise’ ... who render particularized services for the design and construction of particular improvements to particular pieces of real property” as opposed to the class of unprotected actors who are “mere suppliers of standardized products.” Dighton v. Fed. Pac. Elec. Co., 399 Mass. 687, 506 N.E.2d 509, 515 (1987). See also Snow v. Hamischfeger Corp., 12 F.3d 1154, 1159 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2B) (“The purpose of the statute is ‘to protect providers of individual expertise’ who ‘render particularized services for the design and construction of particular improvements to particular pieces of real property.’ ”). 2. Defendant Bemis’s Subsequent Work on Pole 7. That said, it appears equally clear that Defendant Bemis’s subsequent work at Substation 15 reset the clock on the statute of repose to 2005, bringing Plaintiffs claims well within the six-year period and compelling denial of Defendant Bemis’s motion for summary judgment. On January 25, 2005, an employee of Defendant Bemis “complete[d] the installation of new replacement transformers at Substation 15.” (Dkt. No. 62, Def. Bemis Statement of Material Facts, ¶ 15.) The installation included: wir[ing] the new replacement transformers to each other using the existing tap *339connectors that Bemis had originally installed. The length of these tap connectors was not changed. [The employee] reattached these tap connectors to the new transformers such that the tap connectors were in the same position relative to the other component parts of Substation 15 as they were at the time of Bemis’s original installation. (Id. ¶ 17.) At the motion hearing, Defendant Bemis’s attorney explained that the replacement of the transformers required the primary transformer wires to be disconnected and then reconnected after the installation of the new transformers. Similarly, John David Buttelman, an employee of Defendant SMI, testified about the replacement that, “[w]hen I look at maintenance and repair — and I’m not the expert here. But, typically, it’s not just the transformers. It’s the wires associated with it.” (Dkt. No. 71, Ex. 2, Buttelman Dep., 102:19-23.) The proper, or improper, re-attachment of the primary transformer wire lies at the heart of Plaintiffs claim. The birds’-eye photograph makes heartbreakingly clear that, had this wire, or conductor, been pulled more taut, it would have been high enough that, when the guy wire sagged, the uninsulated portion would likely not have come into contact with the conductor. Similarly, had just a few inches of insulation been added to the g-uy wire, it would have been an insulated portion of the guy wire that came into contact with the conductor. Notwithstanding Defendant Bemis’s assertion that it is undisputed that it did no “work whatsoever to the guy wire, guy insulator, guy anchor, or utility pole at Substation 15,” (Dkt. No. 61, Def. Mem. at 2), it is also undisputed that Defendant Bemis’s 2005 replacement of the transformers on Pole 7 included the reattachment of the wire that played a major role in the electrocution of the decedent. (See Dkt. No. 79, Ex. 7, Glover Rep. at 2 (“When the guy was severed, it sagged, coming in contact with the overhead energized conductors attached to the pole mounted transformers.”).) i. General Administration or Repair? Defendant Bemis contends that even if its subsequent work involved Pole 7, this work did not trigger a new six-year period because it was not an improvement but was instead “ordinary repairs” on the installation that had been substantially completed in 1998. Parent v. Stone & Webster Eng’g Corp., 408 Mass. 108, 556 N.E.2d 1009,1011 (1990). Massachusetts courts have held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2B, protects the original installer from liability arising out of ordinary repairs or what the statute calls “general administration.” As described by the state appeals court, “general administration” is “uninterrupted, post-construction professional activities which the defendant performed in an effort to remedy unsatisfactory conditions that were revealed postconstruction.” Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Weston & Sampson Eng’rs, 45 Mass.App.Ct. 120, 695 N.E.2d 688, 693 (1998). However, the statute’s protection has obvious limits: [t]he plumber who negligently repairs a plugged soil line long after the last punch list was satisfied and all professionals paid and released is not engaged in the ‘general administration of an improvement to real property’ within the meaning of the statute, and he will not have available the protection of the repose aspect of § 2B. Id. at 694 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2B). Here, where the initial project was indisputably completed in December 1998, and Defendant Bemis was not called *340back to Pole 7 for four years, the statute of repose offers no protection. This conclusion is supported by the fact that- Defendant Bemis did not return to Pole 7 to do ordinary repairs but to repair a power outage caused by a lightening strike. ii. Continued Negligence. Defendant Bemis further contends that it is relieved of liability because any subsequent work that it performed on Pole 7 in 2005 did not substantially change the original installation. Specifically, it reattached the same conductors to the same tap connectors. Despite extensive questioning at the hearing, however, Defendant Bemis was unable to provide any support, nor has the court uncovered any, for its dubious theory that the six-year statute of repose protects an original installer from liability for subsequent negligent installation solely because the original installation was also negligent. Similarly unavailing is Defendant Bemis’s argument that even if the court finds that the 2005 work reset the repose clock, Plaintiff has provided no causal connection between its 2005 allegedly negligent conduct and the accident. In fact, Plaintiffs liability expert opined that Defendant Bemis had a duty to inspect the guy wire when it was on location in 2005 and that such an inspection would have resulted in maintenance that would have prevented the accident. (Dkt. No. 79, Ex. 7, Glover Rep. at 2.) iii. Plaintiffs “Failure to” Theories. . Plaintiffs theories of liability include allegations that Defendant Bemis failed to inspect Pole 7, failed to remedy known dangers, and failed to warn of known dangers. (Dkt. No. 41, Compl. ¶¶ 38, 52, 57.) Defendant Bemis argues that all of these theories arise out of the original installation and thus are time-barred. While it is true that certain allegations in the complaint refer specifically to the 1998 installation (see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 34, 35), the majority of the allegations refer to general conduct before July 27, 2006. For example, the primary allegation in Count IX, Wrongful Death and Negligence, concerns Defendant Bemis’s failure “to exercise reasonable care in failing to inspect, monitor, and/or ensure that Substation 15 and its component parts thereto were properly installed and/or repaired.” (Id. ¶ 87.) This allegation clearly includes 2005 conduct that is not time-barred. For all of these reasons, the court finds that Defendant Bemis’s subsequent work at Pole 7 in 2005 reset the repose clock, and, accordingly, the court will deny Defendant Bemis’s motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 60). C. Motion for Summary Judgment by Defendant Bemis, LLC.1 Defendant Bemis, LLC has moved for summary judgment on Counts XIII-XV (Count XVI, strict liability, having been dismissed) of the first amended complaint on the grounds that it is undisputed that Defendant Bemis, LLC never worked at Substation 15. Furthermore, because the Asset Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) between Defendants Bemis Line Construction and Bemis, LLC provided only for the purchase and sale of assets, successor liability cannot properly be imposed. “The corporate law doctrine of ‘successor liability’ comprises a set of exceptions to the general rule that a corporation purchasing the assets of another is not liable for the debts of the seller corporation.” Carreiro v. Rhodes Gill & Co., 68 *341F.3d 1443, 1447 (1st Cir.1995) (emphasis in original). Massachusetts recognizes four sets of circumstances under which successor liability may be imposed: (1) the successor expressly or impliedly assumes the liability of the predecessor, (2) the transaction is a de facto merger or consolidation, (3) the successor is a mere continuation of the predecessor, or (4) the transaction is a fraudulent effort to avoid the liabilities of the predecessor. Cargill, Inc. v. Beaver Coal & Oil Co., 424 Mass. 356, 676 N.E.2d 815, 817 (1997). Although Plaintiff makes a colorable argument that the arrangement between Defendants Bemis Line Construction and Bemis, LLC was a de facto merger, Plaintiff is unable to surmount two significant hurdles that preclude the court from imposing successor liability against Defendant Bemis, LLC. First, Bemis Line Construction is still in existence under the name Bemis Enterprises, and “whatever the reach of successor liability under the law of Massachusetts, the doctrine has no applicability where, as here, the original manufacturer remains in existence to respond in tort for its alleged negligence.” Roy v. Bolens Corp., 629 F.Supp. 1070, 1073 (D.Mass. 1986). Second, the Agreement between Defendants Bemis Line Construction and Bemis, LLC, dated April 14, 2006, included a provision in which Bemis, LLC expressly rejected any imposition of liability: 2.2 Liabilities. Buyer shall not assume or become liable or obligated, whether under any contract or agreement of Seller or otherwise for any of Seller’s obligations, Liabilities or indebtedness whatsoever, whether known or unknown. ... Without limiting the generality of the indemnification obligations set forth in Article VIII, Seller and the Stockholder shall be solely responsible for satisfying all of the Liabilities and Buyer shall have no liability or responsibility whatsoever with respect thereto. (Dkt. No. 67, Ex. 1, ¶2.2.) Plaintiffs argument that the indemnification obligations set forth in Article VIII of the contract somehow negate this provision have no merit because they are expressly included in the liability provision. Also without merit is Plaintiffs argument that the contract’s requirement that the seller buy liability insurance for the buyer suggests an implied assumption of liability. The contract required that the insurance only cover the buyer through the closing on April 16, 2006. (Dkt. No. 80, Ex. 1, ¶ 7.6.) Plaintiff has provided no case law, nor has this court found any, in which successor liability was imposed despite an express contract provision to the contrary. Accordingly, Defendant Bemis, LLC’s motion for summary judgment on all counts against it will be allowed. (Dkt. No. 66) IV. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the motion for summary judgment by Defendants Bemis Enterprises and Bemis Line Construction (Dkt. No. 60) is hereby DENIED. The motion for summary judgment by Bemis, LLC and Hawkeye, LLC (Dkt. No. 66) is hereby ALLOWED. The cross-motion for summary judgment by Defendants Bemis, LLC and Hawkeye, LLC (Dkt. No. 80) is hereby DENIED AS MOOT. Counts IV, VIII, XII, XVI, XVIII, XIX, and XX of the amended complaint (Dkt. No. 41) are DISMISSED by agreement of the parties. The case will proceed against Defendants Specialty Minerals, Inc., Minerals Technology, Inc., and Bemis Line Construetion/Bemis Enterprises on Counts I, II, III, V, VI, VII, IX, X, and XI of the amended complaint (Dkt. No. 41). *342The clerk will issue an order setting the case for final pretrial conference to take place on March 10, 2011, at 3:00 p.m. Trial will commence on April 25, 2011, or within thirty days thereafter, depending on the court’s trial schedule. It is So Ordered. . Because Defendant Hawkeye, LLC is no longer a party to this action, the court will discuss this motion for summary judgment only as it relates to Defendant Bemis, LLC.","volume":"850","reporter":"F.

GRIESA, District Judge. This ease involves the forfeiture of funds by the estate of Jeffrey Pieower to the United States. This forfeiture action was filed and settled on December 17, 2010. The settlement was approved by this court via a stipulation and order of settlement on that same day. Proposed intervenor Adele Fox has filed motions to intervene and to amend, modify, or rescind the aforementioned settlement. Fox’s motions are denied. BACKGROUND The origins of this case are with the Ponzi scheme run by Bernard Madoff. Pieower was an investor with Madoff for almost 30 years. Pieower was one of the so-called “net winners” in the Madoff fraud, as he withdrew more from his Madoff accounts than he put in. The Government maintains that any net withdrawals from Madoff accounts represent proceeds from Madoffs crimes and thus are forfeitable to the United States. The defendant in rem in this case represents the net withdrawals across all of Picower’s accounts with Madoff. In the settlement of this case, Picower’s estate agreed to forfeit the entire amount sought. All of the forfeited funds will be used to compensate victims of Madoffs fraud. Irving Picard, the trustee winding down Madoffs operation in the bankruptcy court, is managing this victim compensation. In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Securities LLC, No. 08-01789(BRL) (Bankr.S.D.N.Y., filed December 11, 2008). Picard’s method of compensation is, in short, to compensate “net losers” first and then, if any funds remain, to move on to claims of net winners. Fox, like Pieower, is a net winner. Fox is also lead plaintiff in a class action pending in Florida that asserts tort claims against Pi-cower for his alleged role in Madoffs fraud. This class action was enjoined by the bankruptcy court because it violated the automatic stay called for in the Bankruptcy Code. Picard v. Fox, 429 B.R. 423 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y. 2010), appeal docketed, Nos. 10 Civ. 4652(JGK), 10 Civ. 7101(JGK), 10 Civ. 7219(JGK). Fox now seeks to intervene in the present action. Fox’s main goal appears to be to challenge the treatment of net winners. Fox argues that the priority given net losers is unfair. In fact, in the class action just described, Fox purports to represents all net winners in their quest to recoup funds from Pieower, as alternative to waiting to see if they receive compensation from Picard. Fox wishes the court to prevent the entire amount forfeited from ending up in the hands of Picard because he allegedly will distribute those funds unfairly — i.e., give priority to net losers. Fox claims she is entitled to intervention because, inter alia, she has an interest in the funds as a victim of Madoffs fraud. DISCUSSION Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for intervention as a matter of right and at the discretion of the court. In applying Rule 24, the Second Circuit has held: To intervene as of right, a movant must: (1) timely file an application, (2) show an interest in the action, (3) demonstrate that the interest may be impaired by the disposition of the action, and (4) show that the interest is not protected adequately by the parties to the action. Brennan v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 260 F.3d 123, 128-29 (2d Cir.2001). Fox fails this test because she cannot show that she has an interest in this action. For many reasons, Fox’s status as a victim of Madoffs fraud is too remote to create the interest necessary to intervene. Perhaps the most basic reason is that this is a forfeiture action and victimhood does not create an interest in forfeited property as there is no requirement that forfeited property be given to victims. See 18 U.S.C. § 981(e); U.S. v. Pescatore, 637 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2011) (“[T]he Attorney General is allowed to choose between restoration and retention ... and we are not aware of[ ] any provision in this or any other section that requires the Attorney General to choose either option over the other.”). Thus, Fox has, at most, a contingent interest in forfeited funds, which is an insufficient interest on which to grant intervention as a matter of right. See Restor-A-Dent Dental Labs., Inc. v. Certified Alloy Prods., Inc., 725 F.2d 871, 874 (2d Cir.1984). *127Permissive intervention under Rule 24 is also inappropriate. This is an action in rem and the proposed intervenor has no direct interest in the res. To allow those with, at most, contingent interests in a res to intervene would open the floodgates of intervention in forfeiture actions and thus would not serve the efficient administration of justice. In any case, the proper avenue for Fox to challenge Picard’s method of compensating Madoffs victims is not with this case, but with the appeal by other net winners of the Bankruptcy Court’s decision approving of Pi-card’s method. That appeal is currently pending in the Second Circuit. SIPC v. Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Secs. LLC, No. 10-2378 (2d Cir., argued Mar. 3, 2011). Finally, because Fox may not intervene in this action, her motion to amend, modify, or rescind the stipulation and order of settlement is denied. CONCLUSION Fox’s motions to intervene and to amend, modify, or rescind the order of settlement are denied. This resolves the motion listed as document 6 on this docket.","volume":"274","reporter":"F.R.D.","page":"125","cite_type":"4","ltree":"federal_supreme.federal_appeal_2.federal_district_ny_sd","generated_summary":"Adele Fox seeks to intervene in a case involving the forfeiture of funds by the estate of Jeffrey Pieower to the United States.

Kyle KIMOTO","slug":"united-states-v-kimoto","cluster_id":"8470585","date_filed":"2011-11-22","citation_count":"0","precedential_status":"Published","opinion_id":"8442474","plain_text":"ORDER Kyle Kimoto engaged in a fraudulent telemarketing scheme through his wholly owned company, Assail, Inc., by deceiving consumers with poor credit into believing that they would receive a preapproved Visa or MasterCard credit card if they paid a one-time processing fee of $159. But instead of a credit card, Kimoto’s marks received an offer to apply for a stored-value debit card. Some of them completed the application and paid Assail an additional fee to obtain the debit card, and others did not. A grand jury charged Kimoto with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud plus 13 substantive counts. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1341, 1343. A jury found him guilty on all counts. The district court sentenced Kimoto to 25 months in prison on each count, to be served consecutively, for a total of 350 months. We affirmed Kimoto’s convictions on direct appeal, rejecting his arguments that the evidence was insufficient to convict him and that the government failed to turn over exculpatory evidence. But we ordered a “very limited remand” for the district court to reconsider a single issue: whether the number of victims exceeds 250, as is necessary to sustain the 6-level upward adjustment imposed by the court under U.S.S.G. § 2Bl.1(b)(2)(C). United States v. Kimoto, 588 F.3d 464 (7th Cir.2009). The district court had assumed that anyone who gave money to Assail in response to Kimoto’s solicitations — over 500,000 people — counts as a victim, whether or not they understood that Kimoto actually was pedaling debit cards for their cash. Id. at 494, 496. We concluded that under § 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C) the list of victims includes only those who incurred part of the actual, rather than intended, loss, and thus persons who were solicited for a “credit card” but parted with their money knowing that Kimoto really was marketing debit cards cannot be counted as victims. Id. at 496. Accordingly, we remanded for a “more definite calculation” of the number of victims for purposes of § 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C). Id. at 497. At the hearing on remand, Kimoto sought to raise issues beyond the scope of *684our mandate, but the district court properly declined to consider those issues. After reviewing the evidence, including more than 400 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission from consumers who had paid money to Kimoto, the court determined that well over 250 persons suffered an actual loss. In fact, the court noted, a coconspirator had testified at trial that Kimoto himself estimated during the ongoing fraud that only ten percent of the half-million consumers who shelled out $159 understood they were getting, at most, a debit card. On that basis, the court let stand the 6-level increase and corresponding 350 months’ imprisonment. Kimoto has appealed again, and we have allowed him to proceed pro se. As we interpret his brief, Kimoto argues that his convictions should be reversed on the grounds that prosecutions for consumer fraud are solely the province of state government and that the mail- and wire-fraud statutes are unconstitutionally vague. He also argues, relying on Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the district court lacked authority to increase his offense level based on the amount of loss or number of victims, see U.S.S.G. § 2Bl.l(b)(l), (2), since these factors were not alleged in the indictment or decided by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. None of these contentions is even arguable. See United States v. Joshua, 648 F.3d 547, 552-53 (7th Cir.2011); United States v. Owens, 441 F.3d 486, 490 (7th Cir.2006); United States v. Hausmann, 345 F.3d 952, 958-59 (7th Cir.2003); United States v. Crosgrove, 637 F.3d 646, 666 (6th Cir.2011). More importantly, all of the matters discussed in Kimoto’s brief could have been raised in his first appeal and thus are beyond the scope of this appeal. See United States v. Swanson, 483 F.3d 509, 514-15 (7th Cir.2007); United States v. Husband, 312 F.3d 247, 250-51 (7th Cir.2002); United States v. Parker, 101 F.3d 527, 528 (7th Cir.1996). We emphasized that our remand was “confined to the calculation of the number of victims for purposes of § 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C)” and that “no other aspects of Mr. Kimoto’s sentencing should be revisited.” Kimoto, 588 F.3d at 497. The present appeal is limited, then, to arguments arising from the district court’s further analysis of the number of victims. See, e.g., Parker, 101 F.3d at 528. As the government notes, Kimoto does not challenge the court’s finding that the total easily exceeds 250. And even if he had, this factual determination is not clearly erroneous, see United States v. Locke, 643 F.3d 235, 243-44 (7th Cir.2011), given the evidence before the district court. Accordingly, the one issue left unanswered in our previous decision has now been resolved, and we thus uphold the sentence imposed by the district court. One housekeeping matter remains. Ki-moto filed a second notice of appeal by mistake. After the district court had ruled on the number of victims and Kimoto had filed a notice of appeal from that decision, he filed a motion in the district court asking that his lawyer be discharged and he be permitted to represent himself on appeal. That motion should have been directed to this court in the first instance, so the district court denied it, prompting Ki-moto to file his second notice of appeal. Kimoto then redirected to us his motion to proceed pro se, which we granted. His second appeal was an unnecessary step, and is dismissed. The judgment in appeal no. 10-2679 is AFFIRMED. Appeal no. 10-3108 is DISMISSED.","volume":"452","reporter":"F.

Because he had been previously removed from the United States following an aggravated felony drug conviction, he was charged with illegal reentry, 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a). He agreed to plead guilty and the government moved to lower his guidelines’ offense level for acceptance of responsibility, see U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 (b). The court granted the motion, and sentenced Sandoval-Velasquez to 46 months’ imprisonment, the bottom of the calculated guidelines range of 46 to 57 months (based on a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III). Sandoval-Velasquez filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed lawyer moves to withdraw on the ground that the case is frivolous. See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Sandoval-Velasquez has not responded to counsel’s submission, which is facially adequate. See Cir. R. 51(b), United States v. Schuh, 289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002). Counsel verified that Sandoval-Velasquez does not want his guilty plea set aside and thus appropriately omits possible challenges to the plea colloquy or the voluntariness of the plea. See United States v. Knox, 287 F.3d 667, 670-72 (7th Cir.2002). Counsel does consider challenging the substantive reasonableness of Sandoval-Velasquez’s sentence, but as counsel notes, the district court chose a sentence within the guidelines range and we would presume that sentence to be reasonable. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 351-52, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); United States v. Portman, 599 F.3d 633, 636 (7th Cir.2010). At sentencing, Sandoval-Velasquez argued that a within-guidelines sentence was unreasonable because the guidelines’ calculation overstated the seriousness of his criminal record, which, he said, contained merely a single conviction “in an otherwise law-abiding history.” But the district court rejected that argument because his prior crime was not an isolated indiscretion — he sold cocaine to an undercover officer on at least 3 occasions and in large quantities (the last sale was for over $11,000). The court also dismissed Sandoval-Velasquez’s characterization of his history as “otherwise law-abiding”: he also had a prior conviction for driving under the influence, his wife was arrested for distributing drugs following *908an extended visit with him in Mexico, and he illegally re-entered the United States while he was still on supervised release for his federal drug crime. The court reasoned that 46 months was an appropriate term of imprisonment based on Sandoval-Velasquez’s history of criminal activity and the serious nature of the crime of illegal reentry. The court’s explanation was adequate, and § 3553(a) requires no more. See United States v. Kilgore, 591 F.3d 890, 893 (7th Cir.2010).
